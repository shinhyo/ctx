Agents are useful, but their work is easy to lose. A Codex or Claude session can hit compaction, subagents can do most of the implementation, tool output can disappear into terminal scrollback, and useful decisions can stay trapped in one developer's `~/.codex` or `~/.claude` directory.

ctx gives that work a durable local record. It captures prompts, transcripts, commands, tool calls, evidence, artifacts, commits, PR links, and summaries in a local database that humans and future agents can search.

## Why Use ctx

- **Attach agent history to PRs.** Link a pull request to the record that produced it: prompt, commands, evidence, artifacts, and decisions.
- **Search previous attempts.** Future agents can find old context instead of starting from zero after compaction or a fresh session.
- **Preserve subagent work.** Manager sessions, implementation subagents, review subagents, and imported provider transcripts stay connected.
- **Use your existing agents.** ctx works beside Claude Code, Codex, Pi, Cursor, shell scripts, GitHub CLI, and local editors.
- **Keep records local first.** Your local records live on your machine in SQLite and blob files. Nothing has to be pushed or synced by default.
- **Handle multi-repo work.** A single record can touch multiple Git repos, commits, files, and PRs.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ctx.rs/install | sh
```

Check the install:

```bash
ctx doctor
```

Set up local recording:

```bash
ctx setup
```

`ctx setup` creates local storage and configures optional capture integrations. It does not write files into your Git repo by default.

## Quick Start

Create a record for a task:

```bash
ctx record "Fix checkout retry bug" \
  --body "Investigating the flaky retry path in checkout." \
  --tag checkout --tag test
```

Capture evidence:

```bash
ctx run --record <record-id> -- cargo test -p checkout
```

Attach a pull request:

```bash
ctx attach pr <record-id> https://github.com/acme/app/pull/123
```

Show the record:

```bash
ctx show <record-id>
```

Give future agents context:

```bash
ctx context "checkout retry"
```

Generate a review report:

```bash
ctx report <record-id> --format markdown
```

## The Core Model

ctx is organized around **Work Records**.

A Work Record is the durable history for one piece of agent-assisted work. It can include:

- the original prompt or task brief;
- user and agent messages;
- primary agent and subagent sessions;
- command evidence;
- tool calls and tool output;
- files touched;
- commits and PR links;
- screenshots and artifacts;
- summaries, decisions, and review notes.

The main objects are:

| Object | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Work Record` | The task or unit of work you want to preserve. |
| `Session` | One agent conversation, including primary sessions and subagents. |
| `Run` | One bounded execution: an agent turn, command, review pass, import, or evidence capture. |
| `Event` | A normalized timeline item: message, tool call, command output, file change, etc. |
| `Evidence` | A reviewable result such as a test run, lint command, screenshot, or CI link. |
| `Artifact` | A large payload such as stdout, transcript, screenshot, report, or diff. |
| `Repo` | A detected Git repository associated with a record/session/event. |
| `PR` | A pull request attached to a record. |

## CLI

The main commands are:

```bash
ctx setup
ctx status
ctx doctor
ctx record
ctx run
ctx attach
ctx show
ctx list
ctx search
ctx context
ctx report
ctx export
ctx import
ctx uninstall
```

### `ctx setup`

Creates local ctx storage and configures optional capture integrations.

```bash
ctx setup
ctx setup --with-hooks
ctx setup --with-shims
```

By default, setup is local and conservative. Repo-level Git hooks are optional. The default policy is no repo files unless you ask for them.

### `ctx status`

Shows the current recorder state.

```bash
ctx status
```

Useful fields include:

- data directory;
- SQLite path;
- detected workspace;
- detected Git repos;
- installed hooks/shims;
- recent capture health.

### `ctx doctor`

Checks whether ctx can record successfully.

```bash
ctx doctor
```

It verifies storage, permissions, optional shims, optional hooks, Git detection, and provider capture configuration.

### `ctx record`

Creates a Work Record.

```bash
ctx record "Refactor auth refresh" \
  --body "Move token refresh into a shared provider module." \
  --tag auth --tag refactor
```

Agents can call this too. A useful agent instruction is:

```text
When you begin meaningful work, create or reuse a ctx record. Attach important commands, decisions, and PRs to that record.
```

### `ctx run`

Runs a command and stores the output as evidence.

```bash
ctx run --record <record-id> -- npm test
ctx run --record <record-id> -- cargo test -p ctx-cli
ctx run --record <record-id> -- pnpm lint
```

ctx stores:

- command;
- cwd;
- start/end time;
- exit code;
- stdout/stderr preview;
- full output blob when large;
- timeout/truncation status.

### `ctx attach`

Attaches external context to a record.

```bash
ctx attach pr <record-id> https://github.com/acme/app/pull/123
ctx attach commit <record-id> abc123
ctx attach artifact <record-id> screenshot.png
ctx attach note <record-id> "The first attempt failed because the fixture was stale."
```

### `ctx show`

Shows one record.

```bash
ctx show <record-id>
ctx show <record-id> --json
```

### `ctx list`

Lists recent records.

```bash
ctx list
ctx list --repo acme/app
ctx list --tag auth
```

### `ctx search`

Searches records, messages, commands, evidence, and summaries.

```bash
ctx search "token refresh"
ctx search "checkout retry" --repo app
ctx search "race condition" --primary
ctx search "race condition" --subagents
```

Search defaults should prefer high-signal material:

1. explicit record titles and notes;
2. user messages in primary sessions;
3. manager summaries and decisions;
4. review conclusions;
5. subagent final summaries;
6. subagent internal messages;
7. raw tool output.

### `ctx context`

Prints agent-readable context for a future session.

```bash
ctx context "checkout retry"
ctx context --repo app "auth refresh"
ctx context --record <record-id>
```

This is one of the most important commands. It turns recorded history into compact context that a future agent can use.

### `ctx report`

Creates a human-readable report.

```bash
ctx report <record-id>
ctx report <record-id> --format markdown
ctx report <record-id> --format html
ctx report <record-id> --format json
```

A report can include:

- what changed;
- why it changed;
- linked PRs/commits;
- commands/tests run;
- stale or missing evidence;
- artifacts and screenshots;
- transcript links;
- summaries and review notes.

### `ctx export` and `ctx import`

Moves records between machines or archives them.

```bash
ctx export --since 7d > ctx-records.json
ctx import ctx-records.json
```

Use export/import when moving to a new machine, pulling records back from a remote devbox, or preserving work from an ephemeral agent job.

### `ctx uninstall`

Removes local ctx setup.

```bash
ctx uninstall
ctx uninstall --data
```

`ctx uninstall` removes shims/hooks/configuration. `ctx uninstall --data` also removes local Work Record data after confirmation.

## Capture Methods

ctx collects work through several mechanisms.

### Direct CLI Capture

The most reliable path is explicit:

```bash
ctx record
ctx run
ctx attach
```

This works for humans, shell scripts, and agents.

### Agent-Mediated Capture

Agents can call ctx directly. This is flexible and works even when provider hooks are limited.

Example instruction:

```text
Use ctx to preserve important work. Create a record for the task, attach important test commands with ctx run, attach the PR when created, and use ctx context before resuming old work.
```

### Provider Hooks

Provider hooks capture agent events when available.

Claude Code and Codex expose hook events for sessions, prompts, tools, subagents, and compaction-related lifecycle events. ctx records these events and imports provider transcript files when available.

Capture fidelity depends on the provider. Every imported session/event is labeled with its source and fidelity:

```text
full
partial
imported
inferred
summary_only
```

### Subagent Capture

Subagents are stored as normal sessions with parent-child relationships.

```text
primary session
  -> implementation subagent
  -> review subagent
  -> research subagent
```

Roles are not hard-coded. A subagent may review, implement, investigate, or do all three. ctx stores provider labels and optional role hints, but the graph remains flexible.

### `git` and `gh` Capture

ctx can capture Git and GitHub CLI activity through optional shims or hooks.

Useful captured facts include:

- current repo;
- branch;
- commits;
- changed files;
- PR URL/number;
- PR creation/update events;
- command cwd;
- command timestamp.

The shims must always pass through to the real command. If ctx capture fails, `git` and `gh` should still work.

### Provider Imports

ctx can import existing provider history from local session stores, such as Codex and Claude transcript directories.

Imported records are useful, but they are marked as imported rather than first-party captured.

## Multi-Repo Work

ctx uses one local machine-level database.

```text
~/.ctx/work-record/work.sqlite
```

A Work Record can touch many repos.

Example:

```text
record: "ship hosted work report"
  repo: ctx
  repo: ctx-private
  repo: control-plane
  pr: ctxrs/ctx#123
  pr: ctxrs/ctx-private#456
```

ctx associates sessions and events with repos by looking at:

- session cwd;
- Git root detection;
- file paths;
- `git` commands;
- `gh` commands;
- commits;
- PR URLs;
- explicit agent/user attachments.

Associations include a reason and confidence level, so inferred links are not treated the same as explicit links.

## Multi-Machine Work

Local-first means each runtime can record locally.

```text
MacBook          ~/.ctx/work-record/work.sqlite
remote devbox   ~/.ctx/work-record/work.sqlite
cloud job       temporary ctx archive or sync upload
```

For local-only use, export/import is enough:

```bash
ctx export --since 7d > records.json
scp devbox:records.json .
ctx import records.json
```

For teams or cloud agents, hosted sync can collect records from many machines. That is a separate layer on top of the local recorder. Local recording does not require an account.

## Storage

ctx stores local data under your home directory:

```text
~/.ctx/work-record/
  work.sqlite
  blobs/
  inbox/
```

### SQLite

SQLite is the canonical local store. It tracks records, sessions, runs, events, evidence, repos, PRs, files, summaries, and search indexes.

### Blobs

Large payloads are stored outside SQLite by content hash:

```text
~/.ctx/work-record/blobs/<hash>
```

Examples:

- long stdout/stderr;
- full transcripts;
- screenshots;
- reports;
- artifacts;
- diffs.

SQLite stores metadata, preview text, blob IDs, sizes, hashes, truncation status, and sensitivity labels.

### JSONL Inbox

Hooks and shims write append-only JSONL events first:

```text
~/.ctx/work-record/inbox/*.jsonl
```

The inbox is a capture buffer. ctx normalizes those events into SQLite.

This keeps capture robust: a shim can write one JSON line and pass through to the real command without blocking user work.

## Privacy

ctx is local-first.

- No account is required for local recording.
- No data is uploaded by default.
- Repo files are not modified by default.
- Large outputs can be truncated or omitted.
- Sensitive events can be excluded from sync/export.
- Export and sync paths can exclude sensitive records, raw transcripts, and large blobs.

Use:

```bash
ctx status
ctx doctor
ctx export
ctx uninstall
```

to inspect and control local state.

## For Future Agents

The Work Record is useful because agents can read it.

At the start of a task:

```bash
ctx context "billing retry bug"
```

Before reviewing a PR:

```bash
ctx report <record-id> --format markdown
```

When resuming old work:

```bash
ctx search "why did we avoid the cache rewrite"
ctx show <record-id>
```

The goal is simple: the next agent should not start from zero.
