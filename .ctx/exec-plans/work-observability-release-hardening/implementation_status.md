# Work Observability Release Hardening Status

Date: 2026-06-21

## Local Scope

- Base feature-completion commit: `eaf7c6e` (`Record Work observability done-ness pass`).
- Initial release-hardening checkpoint: `bb6895f` (`Harden Work observability release candidate`).
- Hardening review-fix commit: `64a4012` (`Address Work observability hardening review`).
- Final reviewer-blocker fix commit: `1e075ef` (`Fix Work hardening review blockers`).
- Status/artifact commit: this file is committed after `1e075ef`; use branch `HEAD` for the final local status commit.

This pass is local release-candidate hardening only. It does not push ctx,
open a ctx PR, release, or enable hosted/team/enterprise sync.

## What Landed

- Work Report UI hardening:
  - safe external-link handling for PR URLs;
  - fallback display for pull-request links that only have `target_id`;
  - light-theme contrast fixes for Work Report metadata and raw-transcript notes;
  - focused regression coverage for unsafe PR URL rendering.
- CLI and daemon redaction/trust hardening:
  - `ctx work timeline --json` now emits redacted timeline events without raw `payload_json` or `artifact_ref`;
  - CLI evidence trust refresh now recomputes from the full evidence set, so an older failure is not hidden by a later pass;
  - daemon evidence creation no longer accepts client-submitted `verified` evidence trust as verified provenance;
  - GitHub PR URL parsing rejects non-HTTP(S) schemes.
- Store/search data-model hardening:
  - Work search document IDs include workspace identity;
  - no-text search filtering uses concrete predicates instead of optional-filter SQL;
  - FTS delete is workspace-scoped;
  - migration `0076` is preserved and migration `0077` drops the old strong-link uniqueness index for upgraded databases;
  - cross-workspace primary-key collisions now return an error instead of becoming silent no-ops;
  - duplicate strong PR/commit links across multiple Work records are allowed and surfaced as duplicates rather than blocked.
- Public docs/examples:
  - `docs/work-records.mdx` now distinguishes compatibility `ChangeSet`/`Contribution` commands from first-class `wrk_` Work Record observability commands;
  - e2e walkthrough command ordering and Work ID selection are corrected;
  - example Work Report no longer implies raw transcript notes are emitted in markdown output.

## Validation

Focused validation was run with resource-safe Cargo settings where applicable:

- `scripts/dev/cargo-safe.sh test --manifest-path Cargo.toml -p ctx-http --bin ctx agent_work_cli::tests --locked`
  - PASS, 38 tests. Rerun after `1e075ef`.
- `scripts/dev/cargo-safe.sh test --manifest-path Cargo.toml -p ctx-store work_observability --locked`
  - PASS for `work_observability_rejects_cross_workspace_primary_key_collision`.
- `scripts/dev/cargo-safe.sh test --manifest-path Cargo.toml -p ctx-store work_record_links_allow_duplicate_pull_request_targets --locked`
  - PASS. Rerun after `1e075ef` to cover migration `0077`.
- `scripts/dev/cargo-safe.sh test --manifest-path Cargo.toml -p ctx-store work_search_docs_reject_cross_workspace_doc_id_collision --locked`
  - PASS.
- `scripts/dev/cargo-safe.sh test --manifest-path Cargo.toml -p ctx-daemon --lib workspaces::route_contract::work::tests --locked`
  - PASS, 7 tests. Existing unrelated unused-import warnings remain.
- `pnpm -C core/apps/web exec vitest run src/pages/workReport/WorkReportView.test.tsx src/api/clientWorkspaces.work.test.ts`
  - PASS, 4 tests. Rerun after `1e075ef`.
- `cargo fmt --manifest-path core/Cargo.toml --all -- --check`
  - PASS. Rerun after `1e075ef`.
- `pnpm -C core/apps/web typecheck`
  - PASS. Rerun after `1e075ef`.
- `pnpm -C core/apps/web lint`
  - PASS. Rerun after `1e075ef`.
- `pnpm -C core/apps/web build`
  - PASS. Rerun after `1e075ef`; existing Vite/Browserslist/chunk warnings remain.
- `git diff --check`
  - PASS.
- `git diff --check eaf7c6e`
  - PASS.

## E2E Sample

The local e2e sample created a disposable ping-pong game, captured Work records,
recorded evidence, rendered a Work Report, created a private scratch draft PR,
and posted the redacted Work Report as a PR comment.

- Scratch repo local path: `/tmp/ctx-work-observability-e2e-20260620`
- Isolated ctx data root: `/tmp/ctx-work-observability-e2e-data-20260620`
- Private scratch GitHub repo: `luca-ctx/ctx-work-observability-e2e-scratch`
- Draft PR: `https://github.com/luca-ctx/ctx-work-observability-e2e-scratch/pull/1`
- PR comment: `https://github.com/luca-ctx/ctx-work-observability-e2e-scratch/pull/1#issuecomment-4760981674`
- PR-linked Work ID: `wrk_ea836e3327c44209a4099b150b9bec6d`
- Screenshot artifact: `artifacts/ping-pong-game.png`
- Redacted Work Report artifact: `artifacts/e2e-work-report.md`

Manual screenshot review passed: the artifact shows the sample ping-pong game
with scoreboard, paddles, ball, court, and controls visible.

Leak checks passed for the generated report/context output: no scratch local
repo path, no `payload_json`, and no `sk-` token appeared in the checked output.

Cleanup if desired:

```bash
gh pr close 1 --repo luca-ctx/ctx-work-observability-e2e-scratch --delete-branch
gh repo delete luca-ctx/ctx-work-observability-e2e-scratch --yes
rm -rf /tmp/ctx-work-observability-e2e-20260620 \
  /tmp/ctx-work-observability-e2e-data-20260620 \
  /tmp/ctx-work-observability-e2e-outputs
```

## Review Status

Initial post-checkpoint review returned FAIL findings from:

- security/privacy reviewer `019ee898-7c28-7951-ba24-ac2460dc74e0`;
- product/UI reviewer `019ee898-8017-7431-8d94-0b4e7f81206c`;

- search/data reviewer `019ee898-86c6-7720-851c-c4bd99d049be`;
- test/SDLC reviewer `019ee898-8a8c-7bd0-8428-b3f189c09d4e`.

All actionable findings from those reviews are addressed in `64a4012` and
`1e075ef`.

Final specialist re-review verdicts:

- security/privacy reviewer `019ee898-7c28-7951-ba24-ac2460dc74e0`: PASS on `1e075ef`.
- product/UI reviewer `019ee898-8017-7431-8d94-0b4e7f81206c`: PASS on `1e075ef`.
- docs/spec/examples reviewer `019ee898-8378-75b0-beb5-5d5f2bc4697b`: PASS on `1e075ef`.
- search/data reviewer `019ee898-86c6-7720-851c-c4bd99d049be`: PASS on `1e075ef`.
- test/SDLC reviewer `019ee898-8a8c-7bd0-8428-b3f189c09d4e`: code/test coverage PASS; status/artifact bookkeeping is satisfied by this status/artifact note.

Dedicated final done-ness reviewer `019ee8b7-44ed-7182-9025-12d16ddde619`
(session `28afdbd0-6180-4f83-8c97-f731117ece6d`) returned PASS_READY on
`ctx/agent-work-semantics-primary@4a830c7`: release-hardening final done
criteria were satisfied, with only this status-note update remaining.

## Accepted Deferrals

- Buildkite was not run because this task explicitly forbids pushing ctx,
  opening a ctx PR, or releasing.
- Full Rust workspace tests and broad Bazel sweeps were not rerun on this host;
  focused Rust gates were used to avoid the known local Cargo/linker I/O pressure
  failure mode.
- Hosted/team/enterprise control-plane sync remains out of scope.
- Provider-backed LLM summary generation remains rejected in the public local
  Work route slice.
- The private scratch PR/repo remain available for inspection until explicitly
  cleaned up.
