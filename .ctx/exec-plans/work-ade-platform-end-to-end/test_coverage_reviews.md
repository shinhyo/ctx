# Test Coverage Reviews

Record adversarial test coverage reviews and gaps.

## Status

- Final local adversarial coverage review is complete for current `HEAD`.
- The coverage story is credible for the declared local-only scope: full web
  gates, Playwright visual coverage, affected-crate Rust gates through
  `cargo-safe`, Buildkite/Bazel local source/analysis gates, source-boundary
  scans, and focused plugin/Work/Workbench tests have passed.
- Broad uncached Rust workspace tests remain an accepted host-safety deferral.

## Plugin SDK Slice Review

- Added runtime tests for valid examples, ACP provider JSON fixture validation,
  command source qualification, duplicate plugin/provider IDs, collector direct
  store-write rejection, and deferred contribution rejection when embedded in
  the v1 manifest.
- Added adversarial malformed-manifest tests so invalid JSON-like objects return
  diagnostics instead of throwing.
- Added entrypoint field validation coverage for invalid entrypoint kind,
  non-string args, and non-string environment values.
- Added Bazel `unit_tests` and `typecheck` targets and included SDK unit tests
  in `WEB_TESTS`, closing the initial shifted-left coverage gap.
- Remaining gap: hot reload behavior is not covered by this SDK-only slice and
  still requires the plugin registry/reload implementation slice.

## Work CLI Slice Review

- Added unit coverage for primary `ctx work` parsing and compatibility
  `ctx agent-work` alias parsing.
- Added schema listing coverage and structural validation coverage for
  AgentWork, ChangeSet, Contribution, bundle path safety, and schema version
  rejection.
- Added adversarial redaction coverage for transcript bodies, secret-like
  values, secret-like field names, and absolute paths.
- Added safe inspection coverage for unknown JSON shapes so the CLI does not
  mislabel arbitrary files as `agent-work` and does not print raw secret-like
  fields.
- Added durable diagnostic newline escaping coverage.
- Updated Bazel bin smoke coverage so root help, `ctx work --help`, compatibility
  `ctx agent-work --help`, schema printing, and alias schema printing are
  exercised.
- Remaining gap: `ctx work list/show/capture/export/import` intentionally return
  local diagnostics in this slice. Real store-backed list/show, import/export,
  and capture paths still require the next Work CLI/storage slice.

## Work CLI Adversarial Review Fixes

- Closed high-risk coverage gap where transcript-like event records could leak
  raw assistant/user text through `payload_json`, `content_fragment`, `delta`,
  `full_content`, or nested message-like keys during `ctx work
  redaction-preview`.
- Closed high-risk coverage gap where `ctx work validate --kind
  plugin-manifest` only checked shallow fields by parsing into the Rust
  `PluginManifest` model and exercising structural validation in CLI unit
  tests.
- Added negative coverage for unknown plugin manifest fields, including command
  contribution fields that are outside the public v1 manifest schema.
- Extended Bazel bin smoke coverage to print the `work-bundle` schema and reject
  bundle object paths containing `..`.
- Remaining architectural gap: plugin manifest rules still exist in the Rust
  model, daemon loader, CLI validator, and TypeScript SDK. A later slice should
  either generate validation from one schema source or add a shared contract
  parity test across those implementations.

## Store-Backed Work CLI Slice Review

- Added unit coverage for local store-backed `ctx work list`, `ctx work show`,
  `ctx work export`, and `ctx work import` against a real temp `StoreManager`
  and workspace store.
- Covered full-local export/import round trip so persisted change sets and
  contributions survive across data roots when the target workspace identity is
  explicitly registered.
- Covered workspace-mismatch rejection before writing so imports cannot
  accidentally merge records into a different local workspace.
- Preserved JSON-only stdout for `--json` and stdout export modes so
  machine-readable output is parseable without stripping diagnostics.
- Remaining gap: live `ctx work capture` remains intentionally diagnostic-only
  until the daemon/session capture design lands; it should capture durable Work
  events through daemon-owned semantics rather than direct ad hoc store writes.

## Plugin Contribution Collision Slice Review

- Added daemon inventory coverage for duplicate provider contribution IDs across
  different plugins. The affected plugins become load errors and do not appear
  in the provider extension registry.
- Added daemon inventory coverage for duplicate command and UI surface IDs
  across plugins. These stay loaded and registered because current execution and
  registry records are plugin-qualified, but each plugin receives warning
  diagnostics.
- Re-ran the broader Bazel daemon unit partition, not just the new focused
  tests, to catch runtime and route-adjacent regressions.
- Remaining gaps: bad-manifest reload last-good behavior, in-flight command
  reload/remove behavior, and plugin diagnostics integration into a broader
  diagnostics surface still need later slices.

## Plugin Last-Good Reload Slice Review

- Added daemon inventory coverage for recoverable bad-manifest reload keeping
  the last good registry active and avoiding repeated diagnostic accumulation.
- Added regression coverage for bad-manifest last-good preservation interacting
  with a newly loaded duplicate plugin ID. Both plugins become load errors and
  the duplicate command is excluded from the registry.
- Added regression coverage for bad-manifest last-good preservation interacting
  with a newly loaded duplicate provider ID. Both plugins become load errors and
  the duplicate provider is excluded from the registry.
- Added regression coverage for bad-manifest last-good preservation interacting
  with a newly loaded duplicate runtime ID. Both plugins become load errors and
  the duplicate runtime is excluded from the registry.
- Remaining gaps: in-flight plugin command behavior across reload/remove and
  ADE-visible plugin diagnostics still need later slices.

## Workbench Plugin Contribution Projection Review

- Added frontend projection coverage for current plugin `ui_surfaces` registry
  records into source-labeled Workbench contribution candidates.
- Covered malformed record filtering, unsupported surface compatibility,
  loading/error/empty/ready/fallback states, removed-plugin fallback, and
  delimiter-safe plugin template ID round trips.
- Reviewer found no blockers and confirmed the slice remains frontend-only and
  data-only, without arbitrary plugin UI execution.
- Remaining gap: this is not wired into persisted template selection or rendered
  plugin panels yet; that should wait for SDK/schema parity and a concrete
  Workbench contribution runtime.

## Transactional Work Import Review

- Added store-level coverage for transactional all-or-none import across change
  sets and contributions.
- Added dry-run validation coverage that exercises the same transactional
  relation checks and rolls them back instead of only validating JSON and
  workspace IDs.
- Added cross-workspace ID collision coverage for batch import, including
  rollback of a valid earlier record when a later contribution collides.
- Added CLI coverage for import dry-run catching missing relational references
  without persisting the preceding valid change set.
- Reviewer found no blockers after the slice was narrowed to local import and
  confirmed `ctx work capture` remains intentionally diagnostic-only.

## Declarative Plugin Contribution Contract Review

- Added SDK tests for declarative Workbench contribution buckets in the manifest.
- Added negative SDK tests for runtime-shaped declarative fields, manifest
  processor buckets, null toolbar targets, empty toolbar command targets, and
  unknown toolbar command references.
- Added Rust model tests for public manifest round trips, strict unknown-field
  parsing, null toolbar targets, and unknown toolbar command references.
- Added ctx-types type coverage by tightening toolbar target types so `command`
  and `action` are omitted-or-non-null.
- Reviewer confirmed previous parity blockers were cleared. Residual accepted
  gap: JSON Schema enforces shape and non-empty strings but cannot enforce
  same-manifest command cross-reference or whitespace-only trimming; SDK/Rust
  enforce those semantic checks.

## Declarative Plugin Registry And Workbench Projection Review

- Added Rust daemon coverage for projecting all six declarative Workbench
  buckets into the extension registry.
- Added Rust daemon coverage for duplicate declarative Workbench IDs that are
  valid across namespace-prefix plugin IDs. The test confirms loaded status,
  warning diagnostics, and retained plugin-qualified registrations.
- Added frontend projection coverage for all six declarative buckets,
  source-label metadata, compatibility states, malformed record filtering,
  unsupported IDs, and loading/error/empty fallback states.
- Added direct plugin registry store coverage so declarative registry buckets
  are preserved and sorted through the daemon load/normalize/cache path.
- Remaining gap: visual rendering of declarative host renderers is not covered
  because this slice deliberately projects inert data only.

## Slash Command Source Labels Review

- Added/updated protocol slash command coverage for provider source metadata
  and provider-specific filtering.
- Added plugin command projection coverage for source-labeled namespaced slash
  descriptors.
- Added composer autocomplete coverage for provider/plugin command collisions,
  ensuring the plugin selection inserts `/plugin.id:command` rather than the
  provider token.
- Added autocomplete regression coverage for duplicate descriptor keys.
- Re-ran plugin command invocation tests to preserve routing semantics for
  namespaced plugin slash commands.
- Remaining gap: no browser/screen-reader audit yet for the visual source
  label pill; this should be included with the next Playwright screenshot pass.

## Local Plugin CLI Review

- Added binary-unit coverage for `ctx plugin list` clap parsing with repeated
  roots and JSON mode.
- Added manifest validation coverage for direct manifest files, plugin
  directories, and invalid manifests rejected through the shared Rust manifest
  model.
- Added inventory JSON coverage for plugin id, load status, manifest path, and
  diagnostics.
- Added regression coverage for empty `CTX_PLUGIN_ROOTS` matching daemon root
  semantics rather than falling back to the default root.
- Added reload output coverage for JSON counts and human `local_scan` output
  that names scanned roots and load-status counts.
- Remaining gaps: daemon-connected reload/apply, in-flight command behavior,
  plugin dev process management, plugin logs, and ADE-visible diagnostics need
  separate tests when those lifecycle features are implemented.

## Workbench Contribution Visual Coverage Review

- Added Playwright visual coverage that seeds a real local plugin under the E2E
  data directory, reloads the plugin inventory through `/api/plugins/reload`,
  and renders source-labeled plugin contribution panels from host-owned
  projection data.
- Covered desktop-tight contribution panel behavior and narrow Kanban behavior,
  including no-horizontal-overflow assertions and detail panel visibility.
- Extended browser coverage for source-labeled command autocomplete,
  unsupported declarative contribution diagnostics, exact-row source labels,
  hot reload add/change/remove fallback, persisted plugin-template fallback,
  and active-session composer draft preservation across reload/remove.
- Updated the mobile-narrow case to exercise the actual mobile shell rather
  than a viewport-only desktop shell. The helper opens the task-list drawer when
  needed and the final capture verifies the collapsed mobile work surface.
- Re-ran the full Workbench visual template suite after the helper and
  hot-reload fixes: 20 Playwright visual tests passed.
- Remaining gaps: daemon-connected plugin apply/reload, in-flight command
  behavior, plugin dev processes/logs, executable UI/webview contributions, and
  import/export/redaction preview screenshots remain future slices.

## Public Boundary And Shift-Left Coverage Review

- Added public route coverage asserting org-policy/enrollment/policy snapshot
  endpoints are not exposed by the local public HTTP app.
- Added AJV Draft 2020-12 schema compilation, local `$ref` preflight, schema
  unit tests, Bazel schema tests, and Bazel `@ctx/types` typecheck coverage.
- Added `check-local.sh quick` so schema/type gates can be run before broader
  Rust/web validation.
- Removed unused Supabase JavaScript client dependency and validated the quick
  gate afterward.
- Follow-up extraction removed the lower-level public org-policy/run-archive
  ingest crates, route contracts, daemon route handles, route tests, and Cargo/
  Bazel targets from the public slice. Legacy migration cleanup is covered by
  `ctx-store` tests.
- Remaining gap: public docs and code still have compatibility naming around
  `agent-work` in places. That is accepted as compatibility for this branch;
  a future planned rename should move public-facing names to `Work` in one
  compatibility migration.

## Strict Work CLI Validation Review

- Added negative binary-unit coverage for invalid Work enum values, unknown
  aggregate fields, and incomplete plugin contribution endpoints.
- Re-ran the full `agent_work_cli` binary-unit filter after tightening local
  validation: 27 tests passed through the safe Cargo wrapper.
- Remaining gap: schema and Rust validation are still parallel implementations;
  the final done-ness review should decide whether the current schema compile
  plus CLI negative coverage is sufficient for this branch.

## Final Current-HEAD Coverage Review

- Reviewer Planck (`019ee2c2-52dd-7263-8d0d-352c56d29516`) reviewed current
  `HEAD`, the execution-plan ledgers, and validation evidence read-only.
- Initial result: FAIL only because stale pre-final ledger text
  contradicted otherwise final validation evidence.
- Resolution: this docs-only status cleanup records that final coverage review
  has completed. Planck found the validation evidence credible for local scope:
  final web typecheck/lint/test/build, Buildkite parser and Bazel
  source/analysis gates, affected-crate Rust fmt/check/lib-test gates through
  `cargo-safe`, 20 Playwright visual tests with manual screenshot sampling,
  stale hosted-boundary scan, `git diff --check`, and clean status.
