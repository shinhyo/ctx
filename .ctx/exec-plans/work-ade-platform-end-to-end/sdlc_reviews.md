# SDLC Reviews

Record process, worktree, validation, and agent-workflow reviews.

## Pending

- Initial SDLC review after Phase 0 commit hygiene.
- Final SDLC review before full local validation.

## Plan Review Baseline

- The execution plan now requires manager-owned contract commits before broad
  parallel worker fan-out.
- Worker handoffs must include base commit, diff stat, invariants changed, tests
  run, residual risks, expected conflicts, and integration notes.
- Heavy validation remains serialized and memory-capped.

## Contract Base

- Broad implementation workers must base on `3d1b60a` unless the manager records
  a later contract base.
