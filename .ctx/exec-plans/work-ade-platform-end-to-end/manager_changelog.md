  - Shell syntax check passed after commit.
- `3d1b60a` - Document Work and plugin contracts.
  - Added manager-owned blocking contracts for Work namespace compatibility,
    Work source-of-truth/storage semantics, ACP provider plugins, and plugin
    contributions/capabilities.
  - This is the base contract commit for future parallel worker branches unless
    superseded by another manager-owned contract commit.
- `8123c74` - Tighten Work plugin contracts.
  - Adds durable diagnostic events, old control-plane historical import
    boundaries, local ACP v1 conformance target, approved importer write actions,
    and ID-class collision rules.
- `ee4b219` - Add Workbench template visual coverage.
  - Adds Playwright visual coverage for Classic, Kanban, Multipane, Review,
    dense task lists, and multipane split/focus/resize states.
  - Fixes the HTML topbar wrapper so the topbar host owns the shell grid area
    and the template switcher does not collapse into the sidebar column.
- `308fa83` - Add repo-local plugin SDK.
  - Adds `@ctx/plugin-sdk` as a repo-local, publishable-later TypeScript package
    for current v1 plugin manifests.
  - Adds ACP provider, review panel/command, importer action, deferred
    contribution examples, JSON-safe validation, adversarial tests, and Bazel
    coverage in the web test taxonomy.
- `a703a9d` - Add local Work CLI checks.
  - Renames the public local CLI surface to `ctx work` while keeping
    `ctx agent-work` as a compatibility alias.
  - Adds local schema listing/printing, structural JSON validation, safe
    metadata inspection, redaction preview, durable local diagnostics, and
    explicit not-implemented diagnostics for list/show/capture/export/import.
- `c2af929` - Harden Work CLI validation and redaction.
  - Addresses adversarial review findings by routing plugin manifest validation
    through the Rust manifest model, rejecting unknown plugin manifest fields,
    extending transcript-like event redaction, and adding bundle schema smoke
    coverage.
- `c9d2505` - Add store-backed Work CLI operations.
  - Wires `ctx work list`, `ctx work show`, `ctx work export`, and `ctx work
    import` to the existing local `StoreManager` Work graph.
  - Keeps `ctx work capture` as an explicit local diagnostic because live
    capture needs daemon/session semantics rather than direct store wrapping.
  - Defaults exports to safe redaction, supports explicit full-local export,
    rejects cross-workspace imports, and keeps hosted/team/enforcement state out
    of the public local CLI.
- `e659918` - Add plugin contribution collision diagnostics.
  - Adds daemon inventory diagnostics for cross-plugin contribution ID
    collisions.
  - Treats duplicate provider/runtime IDs as hard load errors because they are
    authority-bearing.
  - Keeps duplicate command/UI IDs loaded but emits warnings because current
    execution and registry surfaces are plugin-qualified.
- pending - Preserve last-good plugin reloads.
  - Keeps the last good loaded plugin active across recoverable manifest
    read/parse/validation failures.
  - Runs duplicate plugin/provider/runtime finalization after preservation so
    last-good recovery cannot bypass authority-bearing collision checks.
  - Adds regression tests for bad-manifest recovery, duplicate plugin ID, and
    duplicate provider ID interactions.
