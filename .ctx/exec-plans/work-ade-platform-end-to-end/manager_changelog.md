    and ID-class collision rules.
- `ee4b219` - Add Workbench template visual coverage.
  - Adds Playwright visual coverage for Classic, Kanban, Multipane, Review,
    dense task lists, and multipane split/focus/resize states.
  - Fixes the HTML topbar wrapper so the topbar host owns the shell grid area
    and the template switcher does not collapse into the sidebar column.
- `308fa83` - Add repo-local plugin SDK.
  - Adds `@ctx/plugin-sdk` as a repo-local, publishable-later TypeScript package
    for current v1 plugin manifests.
  - Adds ACP provider, review panel/command, importer action, deferred
    contribution examples, JSON-safe validation, adversarial tests, and Bazel
    coverage in the web test taxonomy.
- `a703a9d` - Add local Work CLI checks.
  - Renames the public local CLI surface to `ctx work` while keeping
    `ctx agent-work` as a compatibility alias.
  - Adds local schema listing/printing, structural JSON validation, safe
    metadata inspection, redaction preview, durable local diagnostics, and
    explicit not-implemented diagnostics for list/show/capture/export/import.
- `c2af929` - Harden Work CLI validation and redaction.
  - Addresses adversarial review findings by routing plugin manifest validation
    through the Rust manifest model, rejecting unknown plugin manifest fields,
    extending transcript-like event redaction, and adding bundle schema smoke
    coverage.
- `c9d2505` - Add store-backed Work CLI operations.
  - Wires `ctx work list`, `ctx work show`, `ctx work export`, and `ctx work
    import` to the existing local `StoreManager` Work graph.
  - Keeps `ctx work capture` as an explicit local diagnostic because live
    capture needs daemon/session semantics rather than direct store wrapping.
  - Defaults exports to safe redaction, supports explicit full-local export,
    rejects cross-workspace imports, and keeps hosted/team/enforcement state out
    of the public local CLI.
- `e659918` - Add plugin contribution collision diagnostics.
  - Adds daemon inventory diagnostics for cross-plugin contribution ID
    collisions.
  - Treats duplicate provider/runtime IDs as hard load errors because they are
    authority-bearing.
  - Keeps duplicate command/UI IDs loaded but emits warnings because current
    execution and registry surfaces are plugin-qualified.
- `14d28c6` - Preserve last-good plugin reloads.
  - Keeps the last good loaded plugin active across recoverable manifest
    read/parse/validation failures.
  - Runs duplicate plugin/provider/runtime finalization after preservation so
    last-good recovery cannot bypass authority-bearing collision checks.
  - Adds regression tests for bad-manifest recovery, duplicate plugin ID, and
    duplicate provider/runtime ID interactions.
- `725edbf` - Define ACP harness starter hooks.
  - Integrated worker branch `ctx/harness-hooks-20260619`.
  - Documents the future harness starter kit as ACP-compatible modular
    primitives rather than a new ctx-specific agent protocol.
  - Adds example module boundaries for optional shell/file/edit/sandbox,
    transcript, artifact, and Work capture helpers.
- `87cdd71` - Add host-level Cargo safety lock.
  - Updates `cargo-safe.sh` so local Rust validation serializes through a
    host-level Cargo lock and runs under low I/O priority by default.
  - Documents the no-direct-concurrent-Cargo process rule for local development
    agents.
- `2174364` - Add Workbench plugin UI contribution projection.
  - Integrated worker branch `ctx/workbench-contrib-20260619`.
  - Adds frontend-only projection for current plugin `ui_surfaces` registry
    records into source-labeled Workbench contribution candidates.
  - Keeps the slice data-only: no arbitrary React/webview/plugin execution.
- `de4488f` - Harden Workbench plugin template IDs.
  - Removes future-looking action IDs until SDK/schema parity defines actions.
  - Uses delimiter-safe encoding for persisted plugin template IDs.
- `0fd4576` - Add transactional Work import.
  - Integrates worker branch `ctx/work-import-txn-v2-20260619`.
  - Adds store-level transactional import for local Work change sets and
    contributions, plus dry-run validation that executes the same transaction
    and rolls it back.
  - Keeps `ctx work capture` diagnostic-only and keeps hosted/team/enforcement
    state out of public local import.
  - Closes reviewer gaps for dry-run relational validation and cross-workspace
    ID collision coverage.
- `a4a53be` - Add declarative plugin contribution contract.
  - Integrates worker branch `ctx/plugin-sdk-declarative-v2-20260619`.
  - Adds host-owned declarative Workbench contribution buckets to the public
    manifest, SDK, JSON schema, ctx-types, and Rust plugin model.
  - Keeps arbitrary UI execution and redaction/export processors deferred.
  - Makes daemon/Rust manifest parsing fail closed on unknown fields and
    enforces toolbar command references against declared plugin commands.
- `4c8f7c0` - Project declarative plugin buckets.
  - Integrates worker branch `ctx/plugin-registry-declarative-buckets-20260619`.
  - Adds daemon extension-registry projection for `templates`,
    `toolbar_actions`, `artifact_renderers`, `card_renderers`,
    `detail_sections`, and `review_sections`.
  - Keeps provider/runtime collisions authority-bearing while treating
    declarative bucket collisions as source-labeled advisory diagnostics.
- `e86cf92` - Cover declarative plugin collision warnings.
  - Adds direct daemon coverage for duplicate declarative Workbench IDs that
    remain valid through namespace-prefix plugin IDs.
  - Confirms affected plugins stay loaded, receive warning diagnostics, and
    keep both plugin-qualified registry registrations.
- `cd5f76e` - Project declarative workbench contributions.
  - Integrates worker branch `ctx/workbench-declarative-contrib-20260619`.
  - Adds inert frontend projection for the six declarative Workbench registry
    buckets, with source labels, bucket grouping, compatibility states, and
    loading/error/empty fallbacks.
- `903a55c` - Align declarative workbench registry projection.
  - Removes temporary local registry casts now that daemon/ctx-types expose the
    declarative buckets directly.
  - Aligns compatible template/renderer IDs with the public SDK examples and
    adds store normalization coverage so buckets are preserved through daemon
    loading.
- `65d9e22` - Label slash command sources.
  - Integrates worker branch `ctx/command-source-labels-20260619`.
  - Adds source metadata for provider/plugin slash commands and renders compact
    source labels in composer autocomplete while preserving command insertion.
- `c9d0eb1` - Harden slash command source labels.
  - Aligns provider labels with the harness catalog, covers provider/plugin
    command collision insertion with namespaced plugin tokens, and prevents
    duplicate autocomplete keys if duplicate descriptors leak through.
- `aa0db81` - Add local plugin CLI dev loop.
  - Adds `ctx plugin validate`, `ctx plugin list`, and `ctx plugin reload` as
    local scanner/dev-loop commands on the single public `ctx` binary.
  - Routes validation through the shared Rust plugin manifest model and keeps
    list/reload output bounded to inventory metadata and diagnostics.
  - Labels list/reload output as `local_scan`, aligns default/env root
    semantics with the daemon runtime, and documents that this slice does not
    mutate a running daemon.
- `0908e58` - Route E2E cargo through safe wrapper.
  - Fixes managed Playwright local-build server launches so they use
    `scripts/dev/cargo-safe.sh` by default on Unix when available.

    `CTX_E2E_CARGO_BIN` override or `CTX_E2E_DISABLE_CARGO_SAFE=1` opt-out.
  - Documents the managed-Playwright Cargo path in the local development
    validation notes.
