# Work Recorder Productization Reviewer Verdicts

Updated: 2026-06-22T18:01:00-05:00

## Read-Only Mapper Results

- Product/repo split mapper: complete. Found public branch is already slim and
  ADE-free, but CLI/docs/storage contract are not aligned with the final product
  plan.
- Local schema/capture/search mapper: complete. Found the current model is a
  useful scaffold but not contract-compatible; recommended landing schema/types
  and versioned migrations before capture/search.
- Dashboard/report UI mapper: complete. Found no dashboard or visual test
  surface exists yet; recommended backend view models, local server, web UI, and
  deterministic seeded screenshots.
- Hosted/private mapper: complete. Found reusable private foundations but no Work
  Recorder hosted tables/API; recommended a separate worker and private
  worktree.
- CI/release mapper: complete. Found no Buildkite/release/install/platform
  matrix in this public branch; recommended resource-safe wrappers and a Linux
  Buildkite lane first.

No milestone reviewer verdicts have passed yet.

## Implementation Worker Results

- Core schema/types worker: complete. Added core DTO/enums and passed focused
  library/workspace-lib checks; full integrated checks passed after merge with
  `TMPDIR=/var/tmp/ctxwr`.
- Docs truth-pass worker: complete. Produced README/docs changes in a child
  worktree; integrated into the manager branch.
- CI/release worker: complete. Produced resource-safe scripts and initial
  Buildkite config in a child worktree; integrated into the manager branch.

Required reviewer categories from the plan:

- architecture/data model;
- capture fidelity/failure mode;
- security/privacy;
- hosted/API/access control;
- UI visual;
- agent-access/search;
- docs/claims;
- CI/release;
- SDLC/process;
- final done-ness.
