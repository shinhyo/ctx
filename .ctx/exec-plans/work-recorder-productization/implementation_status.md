# Work Recorder Productization Implementation Status

Updated: 2026-06-22T19:53:06-05:00

Task: `feb64c1c-e58c-40f8-b1e9-1094dca0646e`

Public repo: `ctxrs/ctx`

Public branch: `work-record`

Local public worktree:
`/home/daddy/code/ctx-multi-repo-workspace/worktrees/ctx/work-record-product`

Starting public head: `e265a0e`

Plan provenance:

- Reviewed manager plan copied from the manager task worktree into this branch at
  `.ctx/exec-plans/work-recorder-productization/end_to_end_plan.md`.
- Required companion status files were created in the same directory so progress
  does not depend on the manager task worktree.

## Current State

Status: public foundation slices integrated and locally validated.

The implementation has not yet reached any milestone gate. The first action is
to map the current codebase against the reviewed plan, then split implementation
work into bounded slices with separate reviewers.

## Active Workstreams

- Public Work Recorder repo/product split: pending mapper output.
- Local data model, capture, search, and dashboard: pending mapper output.
- Hosted/private staging implementation: pending private worktree setup and
  private repo instruction review.
- Buildkite/release/platform verification: pending CI mapper output.
- Dogfood, screenshots, and final review: pending product implementation.

## Mapping Results

Read-only mapper subagents reviewed the public branch, private repo, dashboard
gap, local storage/capture/search gap, and CI/release gap.

Public branch current state:

- The branch is already a slim Work Recorder repo with four Rust crates:
  `ctx-cli`, `work-record-core`, `work-record-store`, and
  `work-record-report`.
- No tracked ADE-only product code was found in this public branch.
- The implemented CLI is currently nested under `ctx workspace ...` and
  `ctx work ...`; the plan's final public shape wants plain root commands.
- README has product-forward language that is ahead of implementation:
  dashboard, passive capture, shims/hooks, hosted sync, PR publish, installer
  URLs, and local-history import are not implemented yet.
- Current storage has only `work_records` and `evidence` tables, uses RFC3339
  text timestamps, stores stdout/stderr inline, and uses
  `work-record.sqlite`; the plan requires `work.sqlite`, normalized tables,
  integer millisecond timestamps, row-level visibility/fidelity/sync metadata,
  blob references, FTS, and capture provenance.
- No dashboard/web app, Playwright visual tests, `.buildkite`, release scripts,
  installer scripts, or platform matrix exist yet.

Private/hosted current state:

- Canonical `ctx-private` checkout is dirty with unrelated cold-emailing work,
  so implementation must use a separate manual worktree.
- Created private worktree:
  `/home/daddy/code/ctx-multi-repo-workspace/worktrees/ctx-private/work-recorder-hosted-team`
  on branch `ctx/work-recorder-hosted-team` at `58ed2192e`.
- Hosted mapper recommends a new Work Recorder Worker/service surface instead
  of overloading the existing control-plane worker.

First dependency order:

1. Land public core schema/types and versioned store migrations.
2. Align docs/CLI truth and storage path contract.
3. Add resource-safe CI/release scripts and initial Buildkite pipeline.
4. Add capture spool/import/VCS/search on top of stable schema.
5. Add dashboard/report UI and visual fixtures.
6. Add private hosted staging after the public/local JSON contract stabilizes.

## First Integrated Slice

Integrated implementation work:

- Core contract expansion in `crates/work-record-core/src/lib.rs`:
  - typed enums for visibility, fidelity, sync state, confidence, redaction,
    source/session/run/event/VCS/PR/artifact/evidence/tag/sync/audit/context
    values;
  - serde DTOs for capture envelopes, Work Record metadata, sessions, runs,
    events, VCS workspaces/changes, pull requests, artifacts, evidence metadata,
    summaries, files touched, tags, record links/edges, sync metadata/outbox,
    sync batches/cursors/aliases, audit log, and agent context packets;
  - existing `WorkRecord`, `Evidence`, constructors, and current tests preserved.
- Docs truth pass in `README.md` and `docs/*.md`:
  - removed or qualified unimplemented claims about dashboard, passive
    hooks/shims, provider-history import, hosted sync, PR comment publishing, and
    live installer URLs;
  - documented the currently implemented nested CLI surface honestly.
- CI/release local scripts:
  - added resource-capped `scripts/ci-common.sh`;
  - upgraded `scripts/check.sh` and `scripts/bazel-test.sh`;
  - added `scripts/release-dry-run.sh`;
  - added an initial `.buildkite/pipeline.yml` for sequential Linux-style
    lanes and local artifact collection.

## Second Integrated Slice

Integrated implementation work:

- Root command CLI:
  - added root commands for the currently implemented behavior:
    `setup`, `status`, `uninstall`, `schema`, `record`, `list`, `show`,
    `search`, `context`, `report`, `evidence run`, `link-pr`, `export`,
    `import`, and `validate`;
  - preserved `ctx workspace ...` and `ctx work ...` as hidden compatibility
    aliases with integration-test coverage.
- Storage contract:
  - changed default DB path to `~/.ctx/work-record/work.sqlite`;
  - added WAL mode, busy timeout, and foreign-key enforcement on store open;
  - added one-way `PRAGMA user_version` migration foundation;
  - added normalized foundation schema tables, required indexes, unique
    constraints, sync/audit tables, and FTS projection tables when FTS5 is
    supported;
  - preserved current record/evidence/search/context/import/export APIs by
    keeping compatibility columns synchronized with normalized metadata.
- Docs:
  - updated README and docs to present root commands as primary;
  - retained explicit hidden compatibility alias notes;
  - kept dashboard, passive capture, hosted sync, PR publishing, and public
    installer flow marked as not implemented yet.

Known remaining gap after this slice: capture spool/import, VCS/PR normalized
write APIs, search/context ranking over FTS projections, dashboard/report UI,
hosted staging, and Buildkite platform evidence remain unimplemented.

## Foundation Review Fixes

Integrated implementation work after the first architecture/data model review:

- Generated Work Record and evidence IDs now use UUIDv7 through a shared
  `new_id()` helper, while existing serialized UUID fields remain compatible.
- Centralized local path helpers now cover `work.sqlite`, `blobs/`, `inbox/`,
  and `device.json` under the public Work Recorder data root.
- Public CLI JSON responses now carry `schema_version: 1` envelopes, including
  `record`, `records`, `summary`, `evidence`, and `AgentContextPacket` output
  from `ctx context --json`.
- Evidence capture now requires an attached Work Record for current writes.
  `ctx evidence run` without `--record` creates a command evidence Work Record
  automatically before attaching the evidence.
- Full stdout/stderr content is stored as content-addressed local-only artifacts
  under `blobs/<shard>/<sha256>`, while the evidence row stores bounded redacted
  previews and an artifact pointer.
- Focused tests cover UUIDv7/path helpers, versioned JSON wrappers, context
  packet output, hidden compatibility aliases, and artifact-backed evidence
  storage.

Known remaining review item: migrated legacy databases can still contain nullable
evidence rows that predate this productization pass; current store writes and
CLI-created evidence require or create a Work Record attachment.

## Foundation Re-Review Fixes

Integrated implementation work after the second architecture/data model review:

- Archive JSON now includes `schema_version: 1` while preserving the existing
  `version: 1` archive field for compatibility.
- `AgentContextPacket::from_work_context` preserves the default `local_only`
  visibility instead of upgrading records to `reportable`.
- `ctx evidence run --json` now prints the persisted evidence row after storage,
  so stdout/stderr fields are bounded safe previews rather than raw command
  output.
- Evidence output storage now has an `evidence_artifacts` join table so stdout
  and stderr artifacts are both attached to the evidence item. The existing
  `evidence.artifact_id` remains as a primary compatibility pointer.
- Artifact rows for command output now use `redaction_state = 'safe_preview'`
  for their preview text while keeping raw blobs local-only.
- Store open backfills legacy inline evidence stdout/stderr into blob artifacts
  and rewrites inline columns to safe previews.
- Archive import preflights evidence references, remains DB-atomic, and imports
  evidence through the artifact-backed transactional path.

## Foundation Third Re-Review Fixes

Integrated implementation work after the third architecture/data model review:

- `WorkRecordArchive` now includes a backward-compatible `artifacts` payload
  array carrying evidence stream artifact metadata and content-addressed output
  payloads.
- Export reads local blob files for evidence artifact links and writes the full
  payload content into the archive, while evidence stdout/stderr fields remain
  safe previews.
- Import validates artifact payload hashes and byte sizes, writes local blob
  files through canonical content-addressed paths, inserts artifact rows, and
  links stdout/stderr artifacts to evidence inside the same DB transaction.
- Legacy archives without `artifacts` still import through the older evidence
  preview path.
- Privacy and CLI docs now state that full evidence output is stored in
  local-only blob files and included in JSON archives.
- Added explicit archive round-trip coverage for both stdout and stderr payloads
  after the architecture/data reviewer PASS noted it as useful follow-up
  coverage.

## Capture Spool Integration

Integrated implementation work:

- Added `work-record-capture` with JSONL spool writer/importer, pending/tmp/
  processing/done/failed spool accounting, failed import retention with sidecar
  error metadata, and stable dedupe-key IDs.
- Added hidden `ctx capture write-fixture` for local fixture generation and
  public `ctx capture import` with schema-versioned JSON output.
- `ctx status` reports capture spool counts and `ctx validate` reports failed
  or processing spool files.
- Capture archive construction now uses the current archive schema, including
  `schema_version` and nested artifact payload preservation.

## VCS And PR Integration

Integrated implementation work:

- Added `work-record-vcs` with Git/jj workspace inspection, redacted remote URL
  normalization, repo fingerprinting, linked-worktree detection, and GitHub/
  GitLab PR URL parsing.
- Added `ctx vcs inspect --json` and `ctx pr parse <url> --json`, both with
  schema-versioned JSON output.
- Added CLI tests for VCS inspection redaction and confidence-labeled PR parse
  output.
- Resolved merge overlap with capture root subcommands and fixed Clippy
  `needless_borrow` findings in the PR parser.

## Search And Agent Context Integration

Integrated implementation work:

- Added `work-record-search` with ranked local search/context packet builders,
  safe snippet redaction, citations, evidence metadata, token-budget truncation,
  pagination metadata, and optional share-safe dashboard links.
- `ctx search --json` now emits a schema-versioned redacted search packet.
- `ctx context --json` now uses the search packet builder to emit an
  `AgentContextPacket` with max-token controls and local-only visibility.
- Added tests for agent packet shape, why-matched/citations/evidence, token
  budget truncation, dashboard URL safety, and secret-like snippet redaction.

## Dashboard Export Integration

Integrated implementation work:

- Added local static dashboard export via `ctx dashboard export --output <dir>`.
- Dashboard output is share-safe by default: no JavaScript, no remote assets,
  bounded evidence previews, escaped HTML, redacted secret-like command
  fragments, and safe workspace labels instead of raw absolute workspace paths.
- Dashboard cards include local record counts, recent records, Work Record
  states, linked PR/repository cues, evidence command previews, captured output
  previews, capture/search context cues, and privacy framing.
- Export writes `index.html` plus static assets under the chosen output
  directory; it does not publish or sync anything.
- Manager visual review generated and inspected screenshots:
  - `/var/tmp/ctxwr-dashboard/dashboard.png` at 1280x900.
  - `/var/tmp/ctxwr-dashboard/dashboard-mobile.png` at 390x844.
- Visual review notes: desktop is populated with metrics, recent Work Records,
  PR link, evidence preview, capture/search context, and privacy text; mobile
  stacks cleanly with the same safe content. The first screenshot pass exposed
  raw workspace paths and token-like command fragments, which were fixed before
  committing this slice.

## Local Shims And Docs/Examples Integration

Integrated implementation work:

- Added `ctx shim install --dir <path>`, `ctx shim env --dir <path>`, and
  `ctx shim uninstall --dir <path>`.
- Generated local reversible wrapper scripts for `git`, `jj`, and `gh` that
  find the real tool later on `PATH`, preserve exit code/stdout/stderr, and
  best-effort spool capped command capture envelopes into the local inbox.
- Added hidden importer-facing `ctx capture write-shim-command` and capture
  envelope support for shim stdout/stderr, capped at 64 KiB per stream.
- Shim install refuses to overwrite unrecognized files; uninstall removes only
  ctx-marked wrapper scripts.
- README and docs now describe the implemented local-first surface: root
  commands, dashboard export, capture import, shims, VCS/PR helpers, export/
  import, privacy/storage, and explicit not-yet-shipped hosted/provider/import
  boundaries.
- Added `examples/local-record-workflow.sh`, which creates a temporary data
  root, records work, captures evidence, links a PR, exports a dashboard, exports
  archive JSON, and validates storage.
- Added `examples/capture-spool-fixture.sh`, which writes a capture fixture,
  imports it, searches it, and validates storage.
- Added `scripts/check-docs.sh` for doc/example syntax and product-claim checks.

## Capture Auto-Import, Doctor, And Repair

Integrated implementation work:

- Normal Work Recorder commands now import pending capture spool `.jsonl` files
  before serving results, so shim captures become visible without a daemon.
- Auto-import failures are retained as `.failed` files and reported to stderr
  with a `ctx doctor` / `ctx repair` pointer instead of being silently ignored.
- Added root `ctx doctor` as the product-facing local health check command while
  preserving `ctx validate`.
- Added `ctx repair [--json]` to retry failed capture spool files and import
  anything that succeeds.
- Added tests proving normal commands auto-import pending captures and
  `doctor`/`repair` can retry a failed capture file into the record store.
- README and docs now describe auto-import, `doctor`, and `repair`.

## Reviewer Status

Architecture/data model reviewer returned FAIL on head `eb0d8f9` because IDs
were UUIDv4, public JSON/context output was not consistently versioned,
`blobs/`/`inbox/`/`device.json` path helpers were missing, and evidence output
was still inline or unattached. The fixes above are integrated locally and
were committed at `b7abdca`.

Architecture/data model reviewer returned FAIL on head `b7abdca` because archive
JSON lacked a top-level `schema_version`, default context output upgraded
local-only records to `reportable`, `ctx evidence run --json` returned raw
stdout/stderr from the in-memory object, evidence attached only one stream
artifact, and import/migration paths could bypass artifact-backed output. The
foundation re-review fixes above are integrated locally and awaiting re-review
after commit.

Architecture/data model reviewer returned FAIL on head `77d227f` because JSON
archive export/import preserved only evidence safe previews, not the full
artifact-backed stdout/stderr blob content. The archive payload fixes above are
committed at `6c33fb1`.

Architecture/data model reviewer returned PASS on head `6c33fb1`. Follow-up
concerns were limited to future binary artifact support and an optional
both-stream archive round-trip test; the test has been added locally and is
awaiting commit.

Dashboard visual self-review returned PASS for the current local dashboard slice
after redaction hardening. A separate adversarial UI/security review is still
required after docs/shims and any hosted/report refinements are integrated.

## 2026-06-22 Local Product Review Blocker Fix

- Owner: manager continuation after primary agent hit usage limit.
- Commit state: uncommitted changes on top of `83611d2`.
- Scope:
  - Moved public redaction to shared `work-record-core` helpers and reused it
    from store previews, dashboard HTML, and agent search/context snippets.
  - Persisted capture provenance through `capture_sources` plus
    `source_id` links for imported shim records/evidence.
  - Rebuilt FTS as a real, redacted projection and made search use FTS before
    falling back to LIKE.
  - Added regression coverage for secret redaction, source persistence, and
    evidence-only FTS matches.
- Status: focused CLI/unit gates are PASS; full capped local check pending.
