# Agent Usage

Agents should query ctx before repeating investigation work.

## Recommended Flow

1. Run `ctx status --json` to confirm the local store is readable.
2. Run `ctx sources --json` to see which local provider paths currently exist.
3. Search narrowly with provider, repository, file, or date filters.
4. Use `ctx show event --format json` for the best matching result before
   changing code.
5. Cite ctx material in notes or final answers when it influenced the work.

Example:

```bash
ctx search "sqlite migration failed" --repo ctx --json
ctx show event <ctx-event-id> --window 5 --format json
```

## History Research Reports

Use the agent skill as a read-only research workflow when the task is to brief a
human or another agent about prior work:

```text
Use ctx to research prior local agent sessions about <topic>. Run multiple
searches, inspect the strongest events or sessions, and return a concise report
with ctx citations. Do not edit files.
```

The agent writes the report from retrieved evidence; ctx does not synthesize
reports. A practical command sequence is:

```bash
ctx search "<topic>" --json
ctx search "<topic variant>" --repo <repo> --json
ctx search "<topic>" --session <ctx-session-id> --events --json
ctx show event <ctx-event-id> --window 5 --format json
ctx show session <ctx-session-id> --format json
```

For a concise report, include the finding, the strongest ctx IDs, and gaps. For
a longer report, include the question, search method, findings or chronology,
evidence table, conflicts, and follow-up searches. Summarize private transcript
content instead of pasting raw JSON or large transcript excerpts.

## Deterministic Use

Treat ctx output as retrieved source material. Do not state that ctx inferred a
decision unless the cited text explicitly says so. If you synthesize a conclusion
from multiple retrieved snippets, say that the conclusion is your synthesis and
cite the snippets that support it.

## When To Re-Import

Run `ctx import --all` when:

- `ctx sources` shows supported provider history on this machine;
- a search misses something you know happened recently;
- the current task depends on a previous session from another provider;
- you have an explicit supported provider path to import.

Use `ctx import --resume --json` as an idempotent-rescan marker. It is not a
guarantee that every provider has native cursor resume.

## JSON For Harnesses

Agent harnesses should prefer JSON for routing and ranking:

```bash
ctx status --json
ctx sources --json
ctx search "release blocker" --json
ctx show event <ctx-event-id> --window 5 --format json
ctx show session <ctx-session-id> --format json
```

Use cited search snippets and `show` output as retrieved material when the next
step is to brief another agent.
