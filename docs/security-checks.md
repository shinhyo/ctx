# Security Checks

This page defines the checks public docs and validation should keep true for
the local retrieval product.

## Required Invariants

- `ctx setup` reads supported provider history and writes only the configured
  ctx data root and SQLite index.
- `ctx sources` writes nothing in local-only security mode.
- `ctx import` writes only the configured ctx data root and SQLite index.
- `ctx search` may refresh discovered native provider history into the
  configured ctx data root before querying.
- `ctx show` and `ctx locate` write nothing in local-only security mode, except
  `ctx show session --out` writes only the explicit path when one is provided.
- In local-only security mode, setup/import/search do not use network access or
  API keys.
- Provider files are read as sources and not modified.
- Provider transcript imports reject symlinked JSONL files by default.
- JSON output is private by default and must not be described as share-safe.
- Search/show/locate JSON and SQLite search projections preserve local
  transcript text by default, including absolute paths and secret-shaped
  strings. They must be treated as private local data.
- Unsupported providers remain explicit in the provider support matrix.

## Static Docs Checks

Public docs should avoid claims for capabilities outside the product contract.
Run the repository docs check, which scans public copy for removed or unsupported
product surfaces:

```bash
bash scripts/check-docs.sh
```

Validate the provider matrix JSON:

```bash
jq empty docs/provider-support-matrix.json
```

When Bazel owns the docs gate, run:

```bash
bazel test //:docs_check --config=ci
```

## Bazel Security Gates

Run the public local transcript oracle through Bazel:

```bash
bazel test //:local_transcript_oracle --config=ci
```

`//:local_transcript_oracle` imports a synthetic provider history with fake
secret-shaped values, then checks `search`, `show`, and SQLite search
projections preserve local transcript text and do not claim to be share-safe.

## Mode Placement

Security-sensitive product changes should run at least `presubmit`; changes to
setup/import/search behavior should also run `smoke` as described in
[`docs/testing-taxonomy.md`](testing-taxonomy.md).

The default product boundary remains local search only. Security docs and tests
should continue to reject claims that setup, import, search, or doctor
need remote accounts, background processes, repository mutation, or API keys.

## Manual Review Checklist

- README scope matches `docs/product-contract.md`.
- CLI examples use flags implemented by `crates/ctx-cli`.
- Provider support docs match `docs/provider-support-matrix.json`.
- Testing taxonomy keeps the public command surface focused on local search and
  static smoke coverage.
- JSON docs identify local/private output and compatibility limits.
- Symlink policy stays explicit: provider transcript symlinks are rejected unless
  a future change adds canonical root-contained symlink support with tests.
- Security docs do not promise default local sanitization. Share-safe or
  shared-service redaction requires an explicit future mode.
- Public docs do not make strict no-network claims except when describing
  local-only security mode.
