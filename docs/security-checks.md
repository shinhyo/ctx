# Security Checks

This page defines the checks public docs and production validation should keep
true for the search-only product.

## Required Invariants

- `ctx setup` creates only the configured ctx data root and local storage files.
- `ctx sources` writes nothing in local-only security mode.
- `ctx import` writes only the configured ctx data root and SQLite index.
- `ctx search`, `ctx list`, and `ctx show` write nothing in local-only
  security mode.
- In local-only security mode, setup/import/search do not use network access or
  API keys.
- In the side-effect oracle and local-only security mode, analytics and update
  checks are disabled by env so the core no-network invariant is strict.
- With default user config, first-party analytics may create `install.json` and
  send coarse CLI invocation metadata, and update checks may fetch a release
  manifest. Both are configurable in `config.toml` or env.
- Update checks must not replace the ctx binary until signed release manifest
  verification ships.
- Provider files are read as sources and not modified.
- Provider transcript imports reject symlinked JSONL files by default.
- JSON output is private by default and must not be described as share-safe.
- Search/show JSON and SQLite search projections must not expose
  secret-shaped values that the redaction oracle covers.
- Unsupported providers remain explicit in the provider support matrix.

## Static Docs Checks

Public docs should avoid claims for capabilities outside the product contract.
Run the repository docs check, which scans public copy for removed or unsupported
product surfaces:

```bash
bash scripts/check-docs.sh
```

Validate the provider matrix JSON:

```bash
jq empty docs/provider-support-matrix.json
```

When Bazel owns the docs gate, run:

```bash
bazel test //:docs_check --config=ci
```

## Bazel Security Gates

Run the production security/privacy gates through Bazel:

```bash
bazel test //:security_static_audit //:security_no_repo_writes //:privacy_redaction_oracle --config=ci
```

`//:security_static_audit` scans active runtime crates for hidden
network/client, subprocess, browser, daemon, LLM/API-key, and PATH mutation
surfaces, and checks public setup/docs/install surfaces for PATH edits or API-key
requirements. `//:privacy_redaction_oracle` imports a synthetic provider
history with fake secret-shaped values, then checks `search`, `show`, and
SQLite search projections for redaction.

`//:security_no_repo_writes` also runs a runtime side-effect oracle with a temp
home, fake repository sentinels, repository hook sentinels, and a read-only
copied provider fixture. It emits `side-effect-oracle.json`, before/after
manifests, and `no-network-oracle.json` under `CTX_ARTIFACT_DIR`. When `strace`
is available and usable, setup/import/search are traced and the gate
fails on `AF_INET` or `AF_INET6` activity. If `strace` is missing or unusable,
the no-network artifact records a skipped status with the reason.

## Mode Placement

Security-sensitive product changes should run the `production` mode described in
[`docs/testing-taxonomy.md`](testing-taxonomy.md). Release metadata or
certificate changes should add `release_contract`, which proves fixture and
schema contracts but not real artifacts. Real release artifacts require the
stronger `release` mode.

`provider_live` is an explicit manual opt-in for local-history import proof. It
must not run provider CLIs, require API keys, send product network requests, or
write raw transcript content into artifacts. It is not part of the default
production or release-contract gate.

The default product boundary remains local search only. Security docs and tests
should continue to reject claims that setup, import, search, doctor, or validate
need remote accounts, background processes, repository mutation, or API keys.

## Manual Review Checklist

- README scope matches `docs/product-contract.md`.
- CLI examples use flags implemented by `crates/ctx-cli`.
- Provider support docs match `docs/provider-support-matrix.json`.
- Testing taxonomy keeps manual, provider-live, platform, performance, and
  nightly work out of default production unless explicitly selected.
- JSON docs identify local/private output and compatibility limits.
- Symlink policy stays explicit: provider transcript symlinks are rejected unless
  a future change adds canonical root-contained symlink support with tests.
- Security docs do not promise sanitization beyond bounded previews and
  share-safety markers.
- Release install docs do not imply public artifacts before they exist.
