# Security Checks

This page defines the checks public docs and validation should keep true for
the local retrieval product.

## Required Invariants

- `ctx setup` reads supported provider history and writes only under the
  configured ctx data root: SQLite index/config data, and optional daemon
  lock/status/job state when daemon autostart runs.
- `ctx sources` writes nothing in local-only security mode.
- `ctx import` writes only under the configured ctx data root: SQLite
  index/config data, and optional daemon lock/status/job state when daemon
  autostart runs.
- `ctx search` may refresh a bounded batch of discovered native provider
  history into the configured ctx data root before querying. Default search must
  not download embedding models, start semantic indexing, start a daemon, or
  write the semantic sidecar.
- `ctx show` and `ctx locate` write nothing in local-only security mode, except
  `ctx show session --out` writes only the explicit path when one is provided.
- `ctx status` is strictly read-only: missing stores stay missing, and existing
  stores are not migrated, repaired, or used to create search projections.
- `ctx sql` opens only the existing SQLite index, rejects write statements and
  multiple statements, and does not run background upgrade checks.
- In local-only security mode, setup/import/default search do not use network
  access or API keys. Explicit semantic use still must not call hosted model
  APIs, and search must not download the local embedding model when the required
  cache is missing. Explicit semantic/hybrid search may initialize an
  already-cached local model to embed the query.
- `ctx setup --no-daemon`, `ctx setup --catalog-only`, `ctx setup --json`,
  `ctx import --no-daemon`, and `ctx import --json` must not autostart daemon
  maintenance. Search and all JSON-output commands must not autostart daemon
  maintenance.
- `ctx docs` reads embedded documentation and writes only an explicit topic
  output path for `ctx docs show --out` or an explicit man-page output
  directory when `ctx docs man --out` is used.
- `ctx upgrade` uses signed release metadata with explicit self-upgrade policy
  and applies only to official installer-managed binaries with a matching
  install sidecar.
- Background auto-upgrade is managed-install-only, skipped for status/JSON/MCP/
  docs/sql/upgrade commands, requires explicit signed auto-upgrade policy, and
  must not collect provider history or pollute command stdout/stderr.

- A ctx-owned background coordinator, when launched by `ctx daemon run` or
  setup/import autostart, must write only under the configured ctx data root,
  respect `[daemon].enabled` unless explicitly forced, keep cloud sync disabled
  with `enabled: false` and `network_allowed: false`, and may run only bounded
  native local provider-history refresh plus bounded semantic catch-up under the
  ctx data root when the required local model cache already exists. It must not
  run history-source plugins, download models, or use network/cloud sync unless a
  future product contract explicitly enables that behavior.
- Provider files are read as sources and not modified.
- Provider transcript imports reject symlinked JSONL files by default.
- JSON output is private by default.
- Search/show/locate JSON and SQLite search projections preserve local
  transcript text by default, including absolute paths and secret-shaped
  strings. They must be treated as private local data.
- The public provider support matrix contains only supported providers and uses
  only the `supported` status. Unsupported-provider rationale is outside the
  public support matrix.

## Static Docs Checks

Public docs should avoid claims for capabilities outside the product contract.
Run the repository docs check, which scans public copy for removed or unsupported
product surfaces:

```bash
bash scripts/check-docs.sh
```

Validate the provider matrix JSON:

```bash
jq empty docs/provider-support-matrix.json
```

When Bazel owns the docs gate, run:

```bash
bazel test //:docs_check --config=ci
```

## Bazel Security Gates

Run the public local transcript oracle through Bazel:

```bash
bazel test //:local_transcript_oracle --config=ci
```

`//:local_transcript_oracle` imports a synthetic provider history with fake
secret-shaped values, then checks `search`, `show`, and SQLite search
projections preserve local transcript text.

## Mode Placement

Security-sensitive product changes should run at least `presubmit`; changes to
setup/import/search behavior should also run `smoke` as described in
[`docs/testing-taxonomy.md`](testing-taxonomy.md).

The default retrieval boundary remains local provider-history search. Security
docs and tests should continue to reject claims that setup, import, search, or
doctor need remote accounts, provider-history background collection,
repository mutation, or API keys.

## Manual Review Checklist

- README scope matches `docs/product-contract.md`.
- CLI examples use flags implemented by `crates/ctx-cli`.
- Provider support docs match `docs/provider-support-matrix.json`.
- Testing taxonomy keeps the public command surface focused on local search and
  static smoke coverage.
- JSON docs identify local/private output.
- Symlink policy stays explicit: provider transcript symlinks are rejected unless
  a future change adds canonical root-contained symlink support with tests.
- Security docs do not promise default local sanitization.
- Public docs do not make strict no-network claims except when describing
  local-only security mode.
