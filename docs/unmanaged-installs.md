# Package Managers And Unmanaged Installs

The official installer is the recommended way to install ctx. It installs the
CLI, installs the bundled agent-history skill, runs initial setup, and writes
the installer marker used by `ctx upgrade` and background self-upgrade.

Use an unmanaged install when you want to manage the binary yourself. This page
is for users who prefer a direct release binary, mise, Homebrew, or a source
build.

After any unmanaged install, run:

```bash
ctx skill install
ctx setup
```

Unmanaged installs do not write the official installer marker. `ctx upgrade`
and background self-upgrade will not apply; use the same tool or manual process
that installed ctx to upgrade it.

## Release Assets

Stable releases publish prebuilt binaries on GitHub Releases:

| Platform | Asset |
| --- | --- |
| Linux x64 | `ctx-linux-x64` |
| macOS Apple Silicon | `ctx-macos-arm64` |
| macOS Intel | `ctx-macos-x64` |
| Windows x64 | `ctx-windows-x64.exe` |
| FreeBSD x64 | `ctx-freebsd-x64` |

Each release also publishes `SHA256SUMS` for the binary assets.

For pinned installs, GitHub release asset URLs use this pattern:

```text
https://github.com/ctxrs/ctx/releases/download/vVERSION/ASSET
```

For example:

```text
https://github.com/ctxrs/ctx/releases/download/v0.20.0/ctx-linux-x64
https://github.com/ctxrs/ctx/releases/download/v0.20.0/SHA256SUMS
```

## Direct GitHub Download

On Linux x64:

```bash
curl -fL -O https://github.com/ctxrs/ctx/releases/latest/download/ctx-linux-x64
curl -fL -O https://github.com/ctxrs/ctx/releases/latest/download/SHA256SUMS
grep '  ctx-linux-x64$' SHA256SUMS | sha256sum -c -
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
install -m 0755 ctx-linux-x64 ~/.local/bin/ctx
```

On macOS, choose the asset for your CPU and verify it with `shasum`:

```bash
curl -fL -O https://github.com/ctxrs/ctx/releases/latest/download/ctx-macos-arm64
curl -fL -O https://github.com/ctxrs/ctx/releases/latest/download/SHA256SUMS
grep '  ctx-macos-arm64$' SHA256SUMS | shasum -a 256 -c -
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
install -m 0755 ctx-macos-arm64 ~/.local/bin/ctx
```

For Windows x64, download `ctx-windows-x64.exe` and `SHA256SUMS`, verify the
file hash, then place it on `Path` as `ctx.exe`.

## mise

mise can install ctx directly from GitHub Releases:

```bash
mise use -g 'github:ctxrs/ctx[bin=ctx]@latest'
```

For a pinned install, replace `latest` with a release version:

```bash
mise use -g 'github:ctxrs/ctx[bin=ctx]@0.20.0'
```

mise owns upgrades for this install. Re-run `ctx skill install` after upgrading
when you want to refresh the bundled agent skill.

## Homebrew

The ctx org maintains a Homebrew tap:

```bash
brew install ctxrs/tap/ctx
```

Homebrew owns upgrades for this install. Run `ctx skill install` and
`ctx setup` after installing.

## Source Builds

For source builds from a checkout:

```bash
cargo build -p ctx --release
cargo install --path crates/ctx-cli
```

Source builds are unmanaged. They do not use the official release metadata or
installer-managed upgrade path.
