# Limitations

ctx is production-scoped to local history indexing and search retrieval.
These limitations are intentional unless another document says a capability has
shipped.

## Provider Coverage

- Codex local import is supported for documented local JSONL sources.
- Pi local import is supported when matching local session JSONL files exist
  under `~/.pi/agent/sessions`, or when an explicit Pi session JSONL file is
  passed with `--path`.
- Antigravity, Claude, OpenCode, Kilo Code, OpenClaw, Hermes, Gemini, Cursor, Copilot CLI,
  and Factory AI Droid local import is supported only when their documented
  local history paths exist and match the supported native formats in the
  provider matrix.
- NanoClaw and AstrBot local import are preview/manual-path support. They are
  not included in `ctx import --all` or pre-search refresh, and AstrBot imports
  local LLM context plus available platform history rather than guaranteeing a
  complete raw IM transcript.
- Unknown provider formats should not be parsed optimistically.

## Import Semantics

- Imports are explicit; ctx does not collect provider history in the background.
- Current importers use idempotent rescans.
- `--resume` is reported in output but is not a universal provider cursor
  contract.
- Explicit `--path` imports are not remembered as future defaults.

## Search Semantics

- Search quality depends on what providers expose and what importers index.
- Large outputs may be represented as bounded previews.
- Ranking is deterministic for the same local database and options, but it is
  not a claim of semantic understanding.
- Empty or punctuation-only search is invalid. Broad valid queries can still
  return metadata-driven matches.

## Retrieval Semantics

- Search output is retrieval material, not generated analysis.
- Token counts are estimates.
- If a raw source moves, ctx may still return indexed text from SQLite.
- JSON is local/private and can include sensitive content.

## Operations

- Core setup/import/search are local filesystem operations.
- Official installer-managed binaries can use signed release metadata for
  `ctx upgrade` and managed background auto-upgrade checks.
- Unmanaged installs do not self-upgrade.
- No provider beyond the support matrix should be described as supported.
