# Troubleshooting

## No Sources Found

Run:

```bash
ctx sources --json
```

Confirm the provider keeps history on this machine and pass an explicit path if
needed:

```bash
ctx import --path ~/.codex/sessions
```

## Search Misses Recent Work

Re-run import:

```bash
ctx import --all
ctx search "the missing phrase"
```

Use `ctx import --resume --json` when you want output to mark the run as an
idempotent rescan.

After upgrading to `0.10.x`, a refresh can take longer once because ctx marks
older provider import cache rows pending and re-reads source transcripts to
populate touched-file metadata and unredacted local transcript text.

If the raw provider file moved, indexed text may still be searchable, but source
citations should report that the raw path is unavailable.

## JSON Consumer Fails

Run the same command without `--json` to inspect warnings, then run:

```bash
ctx doctor --json
```

Check the command contract in [contracts/json.md](contracts/json.md), including
whether the field is documented as nullable or compatibility-only.

## Store Problems

Find the active root:

```bash
ctx status
```

The default is `~/.ctx`. Check permissions and available disk space. Treat the
database and logs as private local history when collecting diagnostics.
