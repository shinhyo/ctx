# Provider Support

This public `0.1.0` candidate preview uses a strict provider taxonomy. Do not
call a provider "supported" unless it has at least supported-import or
supported-wrapper proof with reviewable output and docs that match the actual
implementation.

This branch proves provider integration through explicit, local import commands
and a conservative local discovery command. It does not install passive
provider-native hooks for Codex, Claude, Pi, OpenCode, Antigravity, Gemini, or
Cursor, or long-tail providers. The first shipped passive capture surface is
the local Git/jj/gh wrapper shim path installed by `ctx setup`.

Authoritative machine-readable metadata lives in
`docs/provider-support-matrix.json`. The shared provider adapter and normalized
envelope contract is described in `docs/provider-adapter-api.md` and backed by
typed `work-record-core` provider structs.

The public release taxonomy uses hyphenated labels. The current
machine-readable metadata serializes equivalent implementation status ids in
snake_case where needed, such as `supported_import` and `fixture_only`.

## Taxonomy

| Public status | Metadata id | Public meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `supported-live` | `supported_live` | Native or wrapper capture, real live proof, review surfaces, and gated evidence are all green. |
| `supported-import` | `supported_import` | Stable existing-history import is proven, but passive live capture is unavailable or intentionally not implemented yet. |
| `supported-wrapper` | `supported_wrapper` | ctx can capture the surface through a wrapper or shim even when native provider hooks are unavailable. |
| `fixture-only` | `fixture_only` | Normalized fixture import works, but no real provider data is proven in the public candidate yet. |
| `detected-unsupported` | `detected_unsupported` | ctx can detect a local install or directory, but there is no safe import or capture path to claim publicly. |
| `blocked` | `blocked` | A concrete blocker exists and needs provider-specific proof before the public docs can upgrade the claim. |

## Current candidate matrix

| Provider | Current status | Implemented path | Source format | Fidelity | Captured | Not captured | Proof |

| Pi | `supported_import` | `ctx capture import-pi-session --input <session.jsonl>` or `ctx capture import-local-providers` | Pi session JSONL | imported | messages, tool calls, tool output, command output, compaction summaries, model/usage metadata, cursors | Pi branch `parentId` values are metadata only; raw images are not artifacts; live hooks are not installed | `tests/fixtures/provider-history/pi-session.jsonl`; capture and CLI tests |
| OpenCode | `fixture_only` | `ctx capture import-provider --provider opencode --input <fixture.jsonl>` | normalized provider fixture JSONL | imported | sessions, events, parent-child fixture edges | native OpenCode DB/export import, plugin/hook capture | `tests/fixtures/provider/opencode.jsonl`; capture and CLI tests |
| Antigravity CLI | `fixture_only` | `ctx capture import-provider --provider antigravity --input <fixture.jsonl>` | normalized provider fixture JSONL | imported | sessions, events, parent-child fixture edges | native transcript import, hook capture, live E2E | `tests/fixtures/provider/antigravity.jsonl`; capture and CLI tests |

`ctx capture import-local-providers` checks known local locations:

- Codex: `~/.codex/history.jsonl`; imported idempotently as prompt history when present.
- Claude: `~/.claude/projects` or `~/.claude`; reported as
  `discovered_unsupported` when present because no native Claude transcript
  parser or hook is implemented.
- Pi: `~/.pi/agent/sessions/**/*.jsonl`; imported idempotently as
  `pi_session_jsonl` when present. `~/.pi/agent` or `~/.pi` without session
  JSONL is reported with a blocker instead of parsing unproven files.
- OpenCode: `opencode` on `PATH`, `~/.local/share/opencode`, or
  `~/.config/opencode`; reported as fixture-only because no DB/export parser or
  hook adapter is implemented.
- Antigravity: `agy` or `antigravity` on `PATH`, `~/.antigravity`, or
  `~/.config/antigravity`; reported as fixture-only until a stable transcript
  schema or hook adapter is proven.
- Gemini: `gemini` on `PATH` or `~/.gemini`; reported as fixture-only because
  native session/telemetry import and hook capture are not implemented.
- Cursor: `cursor-agent` or `cursor` on `PATH`, `~/.cursor`,
  `~/.config/Cursor`, or `~/.config/cursor`; reported as fixture-only because
  native CLI/editor transcript parsing is not implemented.
- P1/P2 provider inventory paths listed below: reported as
  `discovered_unsupported` when one of the documented config/history paths
  exists. These probes check path existence only and do not read provider
  settings, tokens, session stores, logs, or transcripts.

## P1/P2 Classification

The current matrix also keeps `copilot` and `droid_factory_ai` as separate
blocked historical-surface rows. The source branch classified their current CLI
surfaces as `copilot_cli` and `factory_droid`; release management should decide
whether the historical rows become aliases or remain separate contracts.

The command is intentionally conservative. It imports only the sources this
branch can prove safely and refuses to upgrade unsupported providers into
invented capture claims.

## Broader provider work not yet claimed here

The metadata file also carries blocked or classification-pending rows for
Cursor, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Antigravity CLI, Copilot CLI, Factory/Droid,
Goose, Amp, OpenHands, cagent, Qwen, Mistral, Kimi, Aider, Cline/Roo,
Continue/Cody, Auggie, Junie, Kilo, SWE-agent, and legacy ADE surfaces. Do not
treat those providers as publicly supported based on this branch alone. Until
real import or capture proof lands with matching docs, keep those entries at
`blocked`, `fixture-only`, or `detected-unsupported`.

## Source and Fidelity Metadata

Imported provider rows record `source_format`, source trust, raw-retention
mode, redaction boundary, cursor checkpoints, and explicit idempotency fields
in sync metadata. Normalized fixture imports use
`normalized_provider_fixture_jsonl` and `fidelity=imported`. Codex
prompt-history imports use `codex_history_jsonl` and `fidelity=summary_only`.
Detected-unsupported inventory rows use `path_existence_only` detection and do
not claim prompt, message, tool, file, artifact, cost, token, or child-session
fidelity. Pi session imports use `pi_session_jsonl` and `fidelity=imported`.

The Codex history path intentionally does not create parent/child edges. The
local history format observed for this branch exposes prompt log rows only, not
subagent relationships. The Pi session path preserves Pi message `parentId`
values in event metadata but does not convert them into ctx subagent session
edges.

## Shared Provider Contract

Provider workers should normalize native inputs into
`work_record_core::ProviderCaptureEnvelope` values and then persist them through
`work_record_capture::import_normalized_provider_captures`. That common path
owns:

- session/event/source normalization;
- provider event idempotency via provider/session/index/hash dedupe keys;
- cursor checkpoint persistence in `sync_cursors`;
- redaction sanitization before provider payload or metadata is stored;
- shared session-edge creation for parent/child relationships.

`work_record_capture::ProviderFixtureJsonlAdapter` and
`work_record_capture::CodexHistoryJsonlAdapter` are the reference adapters in
this branch. `work_record_capture::PiSessionJsonlAdapter` is the first
provider-specific imported-session adapter added on top of that contract.

## Local E2E Evidence and Blockers

Local provider inventory on 2026-06-23:

- Codex: `/home/daddy/.codex/history.jsonl` exists and contains prompt-history
  JSONL rows with `session_id`, `ts`, and `text`. This validates the gated
  parser shape, but the real file is private local data and was not committed.
- Claude: `/home/daddy/.claude` was not present, so native Claude history E2E
  could not run.
- Pi: `/home/daddy/.pi/agent/auth.json` was present, but no local Pi transcript
  or history file was found under `/home/daddy/.pi` within four directory
  levels, so native Pi history E2E could not run.

Gated real-data check for Codex:

```bash
CTX_DATA_ROOT="$(mktemp -d)" \
  ctx capture import-codex-history --input "$HOME/.codex/history.jsonl" --json
```

Run this only on a machine where importing local prompt history into a temporary
ctx data root is acceptable. The output should report `source_format:
codex_history_jsonl`, `fidelity: summary_only`, and limitations explaining that
assistant replies, tools, command output, and child sessions are not present.

Gated real-data checks for Claude, OpenCode, Antigravity, Gemini, and Cursor
remain blocked until native history locations and schemas are available. Pi
native import should be checked only against explicit session JSONL files under
a temporary ctx data root.
