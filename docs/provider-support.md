# Provider Support

This public `0.1.0` candidate preview uses a strict provider taxonomy. Do not
call a provider "supported" unless it has at least supported-import or
supported-wrapper proof with reviewable output and docs that match the actual
implementation.

This branch proves provider integration through explicit, local import commands
and a conservative local discovery command. It does not install passive
provider-native hooks for Codex, Claude, Pi, OpenCode, Antigravity, Gemini, or
Cursor, or long-tail providers. The first shipped passive capture surface is
the local Git/jj/gh wrapper shim path installed by `ctx setup`.

Provider status is also a security and privacy claim. Do not upgrade a provider
from `fixture-only`, `detected-unsupported`, or `blocked` until the provider
worker lands code/tests for the exact fidelity being claimed and release CI can
produce the corresponding evidence. Unsupported fields must stay explicit:
assistant messages, tool calls, tool output, command output, files, artifacts,
costs, token usage, parent/child edges, and passive live capture are all
separate fidelity dimensions.

Authoritative machine-readable metadata lives in
`docs/provider-support-matrix.json`. The shared provider adapter and normalized
envelope contract is described in `docs/provider-adapter-api.md` and backed by
typed provider structs.

The public release taxonomy uses hyphenated labels. The current
machine-readable metadata serializes equivalent implementation status ids in
snake_case where needed, such as `supported_import` and `fixture_only`.

## Taxonomy

| Public status | Metadata id | Public meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `supported-live` | `supported_live` | Native or wrapper capture, real live proof, review surfaces, and gated evidence are all green. |
| `supported-import` | `supported_import` | Stable existing-history import is proven, but passive live capture is unavailable or intentionally not implemented yet. |
| `supported-wrapper` | `supported_wrapper` | ctx can capture the surface through a wrapper or shim even when native provider hooks are unavailable. |
| `fixture-only` | `fixture_only` | Normalized fixture import works, but no real provider data is proven in the public candidate yet. |
| `detected-unsupported` | `detected_unsupported` | ctx can detect a local install or directory, but there is no safe import or capture path to claim publicly. |
| `blocked` | `blocked` | A concrete blocker exists and needs provider-specific proof before the public docs can upgrade the claim. |

| Claude Code | `fixture_only` | `ctx capture import-provider --provider claude --input <fixture.jsonl>` | normalized provider fixture JSONL | imported | sessions, events, cursors, source metadata present in fixture | native Claude Code history discovery, hooks, live capture | `tests/fixtures/provider/claude.jsonl`; capture and CLI tests |

`ctx capture import-local-providers` checks known local locations:

- Codex: `~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl`; preferred over prompt history and
  imported idempotently as session JSONL when present.
- Codex legacy: `~/.codex/history.jsonl`; imported idempotently as prompt
  history when no session tree is present.
- Claude: `~/.claude/projects` or `~/.claude`; reported as
  `discovered_unsupported` when present because no native Claude transcript
  parser or hook is implemented.
- Pi: `~/.pi/agent/sessions/**/*.jsonl`; imported idempotently as
  `pi_session_jsonl` when present. `~/.pi/agent` or `~/.pi` without session
  JSONL is reported with a blocker instead of parsing unproven files.
- OpenCode: `opencode` on `PATH`, `~/.local/share/opencode`, or
  `~/.config/opencode`; reported as fixture-only because no DB/export parser or
  hook adapter is implemented.
- Antigravity: `agy` or `antigravity` on `PATH`, `~/.antigravity`, or
  `~/.config/antigravity`; reported as fixture-only until a stable transcript
  schema or hook adapter is proven.
- Gemini: `gemini` on `PATH` or `~/.gemini`; reported as fixture-only because
  native session/telemetry import and hook capture are not implemented.
- Cursor: `cursor-agent` or `cursor` on `PATH`, `~/.cursor`,
  `~/.config/Cursor`, or `~/.config/cursor`; reported as fixture-only because
  native CLI/editor transcript parsing is not implemented.
- P1/P2 provider inventory paths listed below: reported as
  `discovered_unsupported` when one of the documented config/history paths
  exists. These probes check path existence only and do not read provider
  settings, tokens, session stores, logs, or transcripts.

## P1/P2 Classification

claims. Their machine-readable rows include primary source links in
`metadata.evidence` and point at the path-existence detector proof in

The current matrix also keeps `copilot` and `droid_factory_ai` as separate
blocked historical-surface rows. The source branch classified their current CLI
surfaces as `copilot_cli` and `factory_droid`; release management should decide
whether the historical rows become aliases or remain separate contracts.

The command is intentionally conservative. It imports only the sources this
branch can prove safely and refuses to upgrade unsupported providers into
invented capture claims.

No provider may be documented as broader than `fixture-only` or
`supported-import` unless the new source format or hook path has redaction
corpus coverage, malformed-input tests, raw-retention notes, and threat-model
coverage. Coordinate those changes with the provider and release workers rather
than fixing a docs mismatch by upgrading the public claim.

## Broader provider work not yet claimed here

The metadata file also carries blocked or classification-pending rows for
Cursor, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Antigravity CLI, Copilot CLI, Factory/Droid,
Goose, Amp, OpenHands, cagent, Qwen, Mistral, Kimi, Aider, Cline/Roo,
Continue/Cody, Auggie, Junie, Kilo, SWE-agent, and legacy ADE surfaces. Do not
treat those providers as publicly supported based on this branch alone. Until
real import or capture proof lands with matching docs, keep those entries at
`blocked`, `fixture-only`, or `detected-unsupported`.

## Source and Fidelity Metadata

Imported provider rows record `source_format`, source trust, raw-retention
mode, redaction boundary, cursor checkpoints, and explicit idempotency fields
in sync metadata. Normalized fixture imports use
`normalized_provider_fixture_jsonl` and `fidelity=imported`. Codex
session imports use `codex_session_jsonl` and `fidelity=imported`; legacy
prompt-history imports use `codex_history_jsonl` and `fidelity=summary_only`.
Detected-unsupported inventory rows use `path_existence_only` detection and do
not claim prompt, message, tool, file, artifact, cost, token, or child-session
fidelity. Pi session imports use `pi_session_jsonl` and `fidelity=imported`.

The legacy Codex history path intentionally does not create parent/child edges.
The Codex session tree path imports parent/child session edges where Codex
records them. It now also normalizes reliable rollout rows for user/assistant
messages, tool calls, command-output previews, reasoning summaries, lifecycle
notices, and command-run metadata when Codex output includes exit/duration
markers. It still does not expand full raw tool arguments, full stdout/stderr,
encrypted reasoning content, bootstrap context, binary/image artifacts, or
file-change details unless those are already present as safe bounded previews.
The Pi session path preserves Pi message `parentId`
values in event metadata but does not convert them into ctx subagent session
edges.

## Shared Provider Contract

Provider workers should normalize native inputs into
`work_record_core::ProviderCaptureEnvelope` values and then persist them through
`work_record_capture::import_normalized_provider_captures`. That common path
owns:

- session/event/source normalization;
- provider event idempotency via provider/session/index/hash dedupe keys;
- cursor checkpoint persistence in `sync_cursors`;
- redaction sanitization before provider payload or metadata is stored;
- shared session-edge creation for parent/child relationships.

`work_record_capture::ProviderFixtureJsonlAdapter` and
`work_record_capture::CodexHistoryJsonlAdapter` are the reference adapters in
this branch. `work_record_capture::PiSessionJsonlAdapter` is the first
provider-specific imported-session adapter added on top of that contract.

## Local E2E Evidence and Blockers

The provider live E2E command is not provider proof in this branch. Normal CI
records only the provider live lane definitions. It does not schedule a live
provider job by default because no provider-specific deterministic live runner
is implemented yet. Explicit exploratory runs must opt in with
`CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_E2E=1` and at least one provider-specific
`CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_<PROVIDER>=1` variable.

```bash
CTX_ARTIFACT_DIR=artifacts/buildkite/provider-live-e2e \
  ./scripts/release-provider-live-e2e-lanes.sh run-selected
```

Provider-side recommendation:

- If `CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_E2E=1` is set but no provider-specific
  `CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_<PROVIDER>=1` variable is selected, `run-selected` writes a
  non-blocking skipped artifact when invoked directly. The default Buildkite
  pipeline still records definitions only.
- If a provider-specific variable is selected, the current provider result
  should remain blocked unless a deterministic provider runner exists and
  produces a live artifact with import/capture assertions, dashboard export,
  search/context checks, and redaction scan.
- If Buildkite marks the gated job `broken` before the script can run, that is
  a release-pipeline or worker-queue remediation item for the release lane, not
  evidence that any provider is supported-live.

Current P0 live lane env vars and provider-side status:

| Provider | Enable env | Current live status | Support status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | `CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_CODEX=1` | blocker artifact only; no Codex command runner or passive hook | `supported-import` |
| Claude Code | `CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_CLAUDE_CODE=1` | blocker artifact only; no transcript parser, hook adapter, or runner | `fixture-only` |
| Pi | `CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_PI=1` | blocker artifact only; no Pi command runner or passive hook | `supported-import` |
| OpenCode | `CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_OPEN_CODE=1` | blocker artifact only; no DB/export parser, plugin adapter, or runner | `fixture-only` |
| Antigravity CLI | `CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_ANTIGRAVITY_CLI=1` | blocker artifact only; no proven transcript/hook contract or runner | `fixture-only` |
| Gemini CLI | `CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_GEMINI_CLI=1` | blocker artifact only; no session/telemetry importer, hook adapter, or runner | `fixture-only` |
| Cursor | `CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_CURSOR=1` | blocker artifact only; no CLI/editor transcript parser, hook adapter, or runner | `fixture-only` |

The release script also recognizes
`CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_E2E_ACCEPT_BLOCKERS=1` for exploratory runs that should
write blocker artifacts without failing. That variable does not upgrade a
provider support claim.

Local provider inventory on 2026-06-24:

- Codex: `~/.codex/sessions` exists and contains 8,652 session JSONL
  files after the Codex-home migration dogfood. This validates the session-tree
  parser shape against live local data, but the real files are private local
  data and were not committed.
- Codex legacy: `~/.codex/history.jsonl` may exist on older Codex
  homes and remains supported as prompt-only fallback import.
- Claude: `~/.claude` was not present, so native Claude history E2E
  could not run.
- Pi: `/home/daddy/.pi/agent/auth.json` was present, but no local Pi transcript
  or history file was found under `/home/daddy/.pi` within four directory
  levels, so native Pi history E2E could not run.

Gated real-data check for Codex sessions:

```bash
CTX_DATA_ROOT="$(mktemp -d)" \
  ctx capture import-codex-sessions --input "$HOME/.codex/sessions" --json
```

Run this only on a machine where importing local Codex sessions into a
temporary ctx data root is acceptable. The output should report
`source_format: codex_session_jsonl`, `fidelity: imported`, per-session Work
Records, and any skipped malformed or already-imported rows.

Gated real-data check for legacy Codex prompt history:

```bash
CTX_DATA_ROOT="$(mktemp -d)" \
  ctx capture import-codex-history --input "$HOME/.codex/history.jsonl" --json
```

Run this only on a machine where importing local prompt history into a temporary
ctx data root is acceptable. The output should report `source_format:
codex_history_jsonl`, `fidelity: summary_only`, and limitations explaining that
assistant replies, tools, command output, and child sessions are not present.

Gated real-data checks for Claude, OpenCode, Antigravity, Gemini, and Cursor
remain blocked until native history locations and schemas are available. Pi
native import should be checked only against explicit session JSONL files under
a temporary ctx data root.
