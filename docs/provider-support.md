# Provider Support

Provider support is intentionally conservative. A provider is documented as
supported only when the public CLI can read existing local history for that
provider from a bounded source format.

The provider import policy in
[`provider-import-policy.md`](provider-import-policy.md) defines the native
storage families and the rules for real conversation text, tool output, raw
diffs, oversized rows, and fixtures.

Machine-readable provider metadata lives in
[`provider-support-matrix.json`](provider-support-matrix.json). The public
matrix's `tool_output` and `command_output` fidelity flags describe structured
metadata and failed-output diagnostic support; successful stdout/stderr and raw
tool result bodies are still excluded by the provider import policy. The public
source formats below identify discovery/import source shapes; stored event
metadata may use the corresponding per-file adapter format, such as
`codex_session_jsonl` for files discovered under `codex_session_jsonl_tree`.

`ctx sources --json` reports each known provider source with `import_support`
and `importable` fields. A source is importable only when provider-specific
transcript files exist and match the documented format. NanoClaw remains
explicit-import only; it is not included in `ctx import --all` or pre-search
refresh.

## Local Checks

Local checks exercise supported imports, provider filtering, citations, and
deterministic search without executing provider CLIs, reading real user history,
requiring API keys, or making network calls.
