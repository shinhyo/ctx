# FreeBSD Release Worker

FreeBSD is a first-class release target for ctx. It is not out of scope and is
not optional for a production release.

## Required Worker

- Buildkite queue label: `freebsd-x64`
- Target triple: `x86_64-unknown-freebsd`
- Required tools: Bash, Git, Rust stable, Cargo, and `sha256sum`, `shasum`, or
  FreeBSD `sha256`
- Expected lane shape: build the ctx CLI on the native worker, write the release
  dry-run manifest, and export the artifact plus checksum evidence

## Buildkite Lane

The public Buildkite pipeline contains `freebsd-native-release-proof`, routed to
`queue=freebsd-x64` with `os=freebsd` and `arch=x86_64` agent tags. The lane
fails closed unless `rustc -vV` reports `host: x86_64-unknown-freebsd`.

The lane runs native cargo tests and then:

```bash
CTX_RELEASE_PLATFORM=freebsd-x64 \
CTX_RELEASE_TARGET_TRIPLE=x86_64-unknown-freebsd \
CTX_EXPECT_HOST_TRIPLE=x86_64-unknown-freebsd \
CTX_ARTIFACT_DIR=artifacts/buildkite/release-dry-run/freebsd-x64 \
./scripts/release-dry-run.sh
```

The expected evidence is:

- `artifacts/buildkite/release-dry-run/freebsd-x64/manifest.json`
- `artifacts/buildkite/release-dry-run/freebsd-x64/ctx-release-metadata.env`
- `artifacts/buildkite/release-dry-run/freebsd-x64/checksums.sha256`
- `artifacts/buildkite/release-dry-run/freebsd-x64/ctx-0.1.0-x86_64-unknown-freebsd`

## Release Requirement

A production release requires `freebsd-x64` proof alongside `linux-x64`,
`macos-arm64`, `macos-x64`, and `windows-x64`. If the native worker is still
absent, the release evidence must include an explicit manager-approved release
exception that names `freebsd-x64`, explains the temporary risk, and keeps the
certificate from implying full platform proof.

## Blocker Status

The contract self-test may still generate a FreeBSD blocker fixture to prove the
certificate rejects missing platform proof. Real release evidence does not need
that blocker when the native manifest and metadata above are present. If
`queue=freebsd-x64` is not provisioned or cannot run the lane, that is an
infrastructure blocker, not release proof.
