# Provider Storage Proof Notes

These notes capture providers that were researched while adding native
IDE/application storage imports.

## Autohand Code

- Source evidence: upstream `src/constants.ts` defines `AUTOHAND_HOME` as the
  overrideable base directory with a default of `~/.autohand`, and
  `AUTOHAND_PATHS.sessions` as `AUTOHAND_HOME/sessions`.
- `src/session/SessionManager.ts` creates each session directory, writes
  `metadata.json`, appends messages to `conversation.jsonl`, loads the same
  JSONL file, and maintains `sessions/index.json`.
- `src/session/types.ts` defines `SessionMetadata` fields including
  `sessionId`, `createdAt`, `lastActiveAt`, `projectPath`, `projectName`,
  `model`, `messageCount`, `status`, `client`, `importedFrom`, and `branch`.
- `src/session/types.ts` defines `SessionMessage` as JSONL records with
  `role`, `content`, `timestamp`, optional `toolCalls`, `name`,
  `tool_call_id`, and `_meta`.
- `tests/session/SessionManager.test.ts` asserts that created sessions contain
  both `metadata.json` and `conversation.jsonl`.
- `ctx` imports this shape as `autohand_code_sessions_jsonl`.

## CodeBuddy

- Source evidence: WayLog `shayne-snap/WayLog` commit
  `6939033b7a39326fbdc249e28e6aa12461db1f09`,
  `src/services/readers/codebuddy-reader.ts` and
  `src/utils/platform-paths.ts`.
- Default storage roots are `~/Library/Application Support/CodeBuddyExtension/Data`
  on macOS, `%LOCALAPPDATA%/CodeBuddyExtension` on Windows, and `~/.codebuddy`
  on Linux.
- The reader recursively finds directories named `history`; project folders are
  keyed by `md5(projectPath)`, project `index.json` lists conversations, session
  `index.json` lists message IDs, and `messages/<id>.json` stores each message.
- Message `message` fields may be stringified JSON; text content can be a string
  or an array of `{type:"text", text}` blocks.
- `ctx` imports this shape as `codebuddy_history_json` and keeps the provider
  files read-only. Schema confidence is based on WayLog plus sanitized fixtures,
  not official CodeBuddy documentation.

## OpenHands

- Source evidence: OpenHands `get_default_persistence_dir()` checks
  `OH_PERSISTENCE_DIR`, then legacy `FILE_STORE_PATH`, then `~/.openhands`.
- The filesystem event service stores events as JSON with
  `event.model_dump_json(indent=2)`.
- Conversation paths are
  `<persistence>/<user_id>/v1_conversations/<conversation-id-hex>/<event-id-hex>.json`.
- `ctx` imports this shape as `openhands_file_events` without OpenHands runtime
  dependencies.

## Zed

- Source evidence: Zed persists agent threads in SQLite at
  `<Zed data dir>/threads/threads.db`.
- Table shape observed in source:
  `threads(id, summary, updated_at, data_type, data, parent_id, folder_paths, folder_paths_order, created_at)`.
- The `data` column is zstd-compressed JSON for `DbThread`, including messages,
  summaries, token usage, model/profile metadata, and draft prompt state.
- `ZED_STATELESS` disables persistent DB use.
- Gap: native import needs a zstd decoder dependency plus a stable fixture for
  compressed `DbThread` JSON. This pass did not add that dependency.

## Void

- Source evidence: Void stores chat threads through VS Code/Electron application
  storage.
- Current key: `void.chatThreadStorageII`; older keys:
  `void.chatThreadStorage` and `void.chatThreadStorageI`.
- Values are JSON-serialized chat thread/message structures in application
  storage.
- Gap: native import needs a small, proven reader for the VS Code/Electron
  storage location and key formats, plus fixtures covering all three keys.
