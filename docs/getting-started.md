# Getting Started

ctx indexes local agent history so an agent can search previous sessions before
it repeats work.

## 1. Install The CLI

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ctx.rs/install | sh
```

The Unix installer requires `curl` and OpenSSL to verify signed release
metadata. On Windows, use `irm https://ctx.rs/install.ps1 | iex`.

On Unix, the installer places `ctx` in `${CTX_BIN_DIR:-$HOME/.local/bin}`. If
that directory is not already on `PATH`, the installer adds an idempotent ctx
PATH snippet to your shell startup file and prints the command to use for the
current shell session. On Windows, the installer places `ctx.exe` in
`$HOME\.local\bin` by default, adds that directory to the user `Path`, and
updates the current PowerShell session. Use `sh -s -- --no-modify-path` on Unix,
`-NoModifyPath` on Windows, or set `CTX_INSTALL_NO_MODIFY_PATH=1` when you want
to manage `PATH` yourself.

The install script installs `ctx`, runs the bundled agent-history skill
installer, and runs `ctx setup` so discovered local history is indexed before it
exits. The skill installer opens an agent picker when interactive; otherwise it
installs the universal `~/.agents/skills` copy plus detected agent-specific
folders for tools that need them. Use `sh -s -- --no-setup` on Unix, or set
`CTX_INSTALL_NO_SETUP=1` on Windows, for install-only CI or packaging flows.
Install-only mode also skips skill setup unless you explicitly pass a skill
option.

To skip only the skill step, use `--no-skill` on Unix or `-NoSkill` on Windows,
or set `CTX_INSTALL_NO_SKILL=1`. To target agent-specific skill folders during
install, use `--skill-agent codex`, repeat `--skill-agent`, or use
`--all-skill-agents`; Windows exposes the same controls as `-SkillAgent` and
`-AllSkillAgents`.

When working from source, use `cargo build -p ctx` or
`cargo install --path crates/ctx-cli`.

## 2. Set Up And Index

```bash
ctx setup
ctx status
```

Setup creates the configured ctx data root, initializes SQLite, writes
`config.toml` when missing, discovers known provider history paths, catalogs
Codex sessions, imports discovered native provider sources, optimizes the local
search index, and prints next steps. It does not execute history-source plugin
commands. The default data root is `~/.ctx`.

Use a different root when testing:

```bash
ctx --data-root /tmp/ctx-demo setup
CTX_DATA_ROOT=/tmp/ctx-demo ctx status
```

Setup does not write to source repositories, call model APIs, or require API
keys. Official installer-managed binaries can run a signed background
auto-upgrade check after later successful non-JSON commands; that updater does
not collect provider history.

## 3. See Available Sources

```bash
ctx sources
ctx sources --json
```

`sources` checks known provider locations on the current machine. Today it
reports supported Codex, Pi, Antigravity, Claude, OpenCode, Gemini, Cursor,
Copilot CLI, and Factory AI Droid local history paths. JSON rows include
`status` and `importable`; `status: "empty"` means the default location exists
but no provider-specific transcript files were found there, and
`status: "unknown"` means the bounded transcript probe hit its scan budget.

## 4. Re-Run Or Target Imports

```bash
ctx import --all
ctx import --provider codex
ctx import --provider pi
ctx import --provider cursor
ctx import --provider codex --path ~/.codex/sessions
ctx import --resume --json
```

Setup already imports discovered sources. Use `ctx import` to repair, re-run,
resume, or target a specific provider/path. Current importers rescan sources
idempotently and skip or replace unchanged indexed rows. The `--resume` flag is
reported as `idempotent_rescan`; it does not yet mean every provider has a
native cursor-resume API.

After upgrading an older data root to `0.10.x` or newer, the first refresh or import may
re-read previously indexed provider transcripts once. That rebuilds search
content with touched-file metadata and local/private transcript text.

Native provider `--path` imports require `--provider`. Custom JSONL imports use
`--format ctx-history-jsonl-v1 --path <file>` instead.

## 5. Search

```bash
ctx search "failed migration"
ctx search "failed migration" --term sqlite --term rollback
ctx show event <ctx-event-id> --window 3
ctx show session <ctx-session-id>
```

Use `ctx_event_id` with `ctx show event` when you need a hit plus surrounding
events. Use `ctx_session_id` with `ctx show session` when you need the
transcript. Commands accept full ctx IDs or unambiguous ID prefixes of at least
eight hex characters. Search also accepts filters such as `--provider`,
`--workspace`, `--since`, `--event-type`, `--file`, `--include-subagents`,
`--include-current-session`, `--term`, `--limit`, and
`--refresh auto|off|strict`.
`--limit` is capped at `200`.
Search defaults to `--refresh auto`, a best-effort refresh of discovered native
provider sources before querying. On large discovered sources or
already-cataloged indexes, `auto` serves current results without a foreground
catch-up scan; use
`--refresh strict` or `ctx import --all` when you need a full
catch-up before querying.

When ctx runs inside Codex, search excludes the active Codex session tree by
default when it can identify it. Use `--include-current-session` if the current
session or its subagent work is the history you want to search. Use
`--refresh off` when you need a strictly read-only query over the existing ctx
index.

## 6. Use JSON For Scripts

```bash
ctx search "failed migration" --json | jq '.results[0].ctx_event_id'
ctx show event <ctx-event-id> --format json
ctx show session <ctx-session-id> --format json
```

Default text output is usually better for agent reading. Search JSON is the
supported machine-readable retrieval API for scripts and exact field
extraction. It contains cited snippets and source metadata, but it is retrieved
source material rather than generated analysis.

## 7. Built-In Docs And Upgrades

```bash
ctx docs search "file path"
ctx docs show cli-reference
ctx docs man --print ctx
ctx upgrade status
ctx upgrade check
```

`ctx docs` reads embedded public docs from the installed binary. Agents should
prefer `ctx docs search` and `ctx docs show` over man pages; man pages are
available for human shell use.

`ctx upgrade` works for official installer-managed binaries. Source builds,
`cargo install`, package-manager installs, and copied binaries are treated as
unmanaged and will not self-upgrade. Use `ctx upgrade disable` or
`CTX_UPGRADE_OFF=1` to disable managed background auto-upgrade.
