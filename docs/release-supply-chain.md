# Release Supply Chain

The current public release plan is non-publishing. Buildkite release dry-runs
build host binaries, write manifests, write SHA-256 checksum files, and produce
a completion certificate scaffold. They do not upload, sign, notarize, or move
a release channel.

## Finished-Product Evidence Matrix

The Buildkite pipeline includes non-publishing, resource-capped evidence lanes
for the finished-product review:

- provider fixture import validates inert Codex, Pi, and Claude provider JSONL
  fixtures and the focused provider replay import tests;
- rich search/context creates local records and evidence, then stores search
  and context JSON artifacts;
- dashboard/report artifact review exports local report JSON and dashboard HTML
  for inspection;
- PR publish dry-run renders the marker-bounded pull request comment without a
  network write;
- security/malicious archive fixtures check redaction corpus coverage and
  hostile archive test markers;
- jj e2e blocker status records whether `jj` is available on the runner without
  installing external tools;
- installer dry-run smoke validates local release metadata and an installer
  plan without downloading or installing binaries.

The completion certificate references these artifacts beside the platform
release dry-run manifests, provider live E2E lane definitions, the combined
release-candidate metadata, the R2 upload plan, and the FreeBSD blocker
artifact.

Current-head release completion is not implied by local self-tests. The
certificate validator requires Linux x64, macOS arm64, macOS x64, and Windows
x64 release dry-run manifests whose `git_commit` matches the current checkout,
plus the explicit FreeBSD blocker artifact. Synthetic self-test manifests are
marked as fixtures and are rejected by normal certificate runs.

Installer/release smoke status for this branch is dry-run only. The installer
smoke validates metadata parsing, unsafe input refusals, and the planned
install path, but it does not download, install, sign, notarize, or publish a
release artifact. The R2 upload plan is generated as commands and cleanup
instructions only; it is not executed by CI.

## Provider Live E2E

Normal CI records provider live E2E lane definitions in
`artifacts/buildkite/provider-live-e2e-lanes`. The live lanes are disabled by
default and require `CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_E2E=1` plus a provider-specific opt-in
variable such as `CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_CODEX=1`. The current release/CI slice
emits blocker artifacts for live runs until provider workers add real
deterministic commands and redaction assertions.

No provider may be documented as `supported-live` unless its support-matrix row
has a real live E2E artifact from the gated lane.

## R2 Staging Layout

The release-candidate metadata lane writes:

- `install.sh`
- `install.ps1`
- `ctx-release-metadata.env`
- `checksums.sha256`
- `release-candidate-manifest.json`
- `r2-upload-plan.md`
- `r2-upload-commands.sh`

The default staging prefix is
`ctx/records/release-candidate/v0.1.0/<git-commit>` in the
`ctx-release-artifacts` bucket. The public installer base URL must be
provided by `CTX_RELEASE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` before an installer smoke can target
real R2 objects.

## Checksums

Every installable artifact must have one SHA-256 digest in release metadata and
in `checksums.sha256`. Installers verify the digest before copying a binary into
place and reject placeholder digests. Metadata is parsed as data, not executed.

## SBOM

SBOM publication is a release blocker until a concrete generator and output
format are selected. The preferred shape is one SBOM per platform artifact plus
a top-level index referenced by the completion certificate. Candidate formats
are SPDX JSON or CycloneDX JSON.

## Provenance

Build provenance is a release blocker until the release job can emit signed
provenance for each artifact. The expected evidence is an artifact-level
statement that binds repository, commit, Buildkite build URL, target triple,
artifact name, digest, and builder identity.

## Signing And Notarization

Signing is required before production publication:

- macOS artifacts require Developer ID signing and notarization before the
  installer metadata points at them.
- Windows artifacts require Authenticode signing before publication.
- Linux and FreeBSD artifacts should be signed with the selected release
  signing key, with public verification instructions published beside the
  checksums.

The current repository does not contain signing credentials or notarization
secrets. Release jobs must fail closed when credentials are absent.

## Completion Certificate

`scripts/release-completion-certificate.sh` writes a non-publishing certificate
artifact that lists required evidence and unresolved external blockers. The
certificate is a scaffold for finished-product review; it is not a release
approval by itself.
