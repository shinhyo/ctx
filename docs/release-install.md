# Release Install Notes

No public release install command is published for ctx yet. Release artifacts,
checksums, signatures, and verification instructions must exist before this
page can add a public installer command.

The current source build path is:

```bash
cargo build -p ctx
cargo install --path crates/ctx-cli
```

This source build path is not release approval. It proves that a local checkout
can build the CLI; it does not prove a public binary, package, signature,
notarization result, SBOM, provenance statement, or R2 object upload.

Public install instructions stay blocked until all of the following are true:

- Multi-platform release artifacts exist for `linux-x64`, `macos-arm64`,
  `macos-x64`, `windows-x64`, and `freebsd-x64`, or an explicit
  manager-approved release exception names the missing target.
- Published checksums match those artifacts.
- Signing, notarization, SBOM, and provenance evidence is approved.
- R2 staging has passed with approved credentials.
- The completion certificate records real release evidence, not a contract
  fixture self-test.
