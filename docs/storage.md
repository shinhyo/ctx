# Storage And Privacy

ctx stores search indexes locally. Treat the ctx data root like private source
history.

## Local Layout

Default root:

```text
~/.ctx/
  work.sqlite
  config.toml
  runtime/
    onnxruntime/
      <runtime-version>/
        <platform>/
  upgrade-state.json
  upgrade.lock
  logs/
    upgrade.log
```

`CTX_DATA_ROOT` or `--data-root` may point ctx somewhere else. The configured
root is used directly; ctx does not append another directory.

Official installer-managed binaries also have a sidecar next to the installed
binary, for example:

```text
~/.local/bin/ctx
~/.local/bin/ctx.install.json
```

The sidecar is outside the ctx data root because it describes ownership of the
installed executable, not indexed provider history.

When release metadata includes ctx-managed ONNX Runtime assets, the official
installer and development installer place those native runtime files under
`${CTX_RUNTIME_DIR:-$HOME/.ctx/runtime}/onnxruntime/<runtime-version>/<platform>`.
They are product runtime assets, not provider-history storage, and may be shared
by multiple ctx data roots on the same machine.

## What SQLite Stores

The SQLite store may contain:

- provider and source metadata;
- source file paths and import cursors when available;
- session IDs and event IDs;
- timestamps and working-directory metadata when known;
- normalized user, assistant, system, and developer conversation text;
- tool-call, command, file-touch, and lifecycle metadata;
- bounded diagnostic previews for failed or timed-out command/tool output;
- FTS-indexable text required for search;
- citations and offsets or line/cursor metadata when available;
- compatibility rows used by the current search implementation.

If text is searchable, assume a copy or normalized form exists in SQLite. Raw
provider transcript files may still remain in provider-owned locations such as
`~/.codex/sessions`, but the searchable parts are local ctx data too.

## What ctx Avoids By Default

The current CLI avoids copying unbounded stdout, stderr, binary artifacts, image
payloads, raw diffs, and provider-private blobs into SQLite. When a provider
transcript has large raw payloads, ctx should store metadata, a citation back to
the raw source path when available, and only bounded diagnostic previews that
are useful for local search. See
[`provider-import-policy.md`](provider-import-policy.md) for the native adapter
content policy.

Provider-specific sensitive handles should stay out of normalized metadata when
they are not needed for local search. For example, the Warp SQLite importer
records only boolean presence for Warp server conversation tokens and does not
copy token values from `agent_conversations.conversation_data`.

No session text, prompts, transcripts, or indexed snippets are sent by ctx by
default.

## Provider-Owned Data

ctx does not own provider homes. Import reads from configured or discovered
locations and records enough information to search and cite imported material.
If a raw source path moves or is deleted, `ctx show` and `ctx search` can still
return indexed text and should mark source availability when that information
is known.

## Command Read/Write Behavior

This table describes core command effects. It excludes the optional first-party
analytics marker described under network behavior.

| Command | Reads | Writes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ctx setup` | provider transcript files and home path metadata for source discovery | data root, `work.sqlite`, SQLite index, and optional daemon lock/status/job files when daemon autostart runs |
| `ctx status` | data root metadata, existing SQLite store, semantic sidecar/status metadata, and ctx-owned daemon lock/status/job metadata | none |
| `ctx sources` | known provider paths under the user's home and local history-source plugin manifests | none |
| `ctx import` | provider transcript files and path metadata, the explicit custom history JSONL file passed with `--format ctx-history-jsonl-v1 --path`, or stdout from an explicit history-source plugin command | data root, SQLite index, and optional daemon lock/status/job files when daemon autostart runs |
| `ctx show` | SQLite index | selected `--out` path for `show session` when provided |
| `ctx locate` | SQLite index and raw source path metadata | none |
| `ctx search` | native provider transcript files, path metadata, enabled auto history-source plugin stdout, SQLite index, and existing semantic sidecar/status metadata | SQLite index for newly discovered native provider or plugin history, and optional daemon lock/status/query endpoint files when semantic-enabled background refresh autostarts daemon maintenance |
| `ctx sql` | existing SQLite index only | none |
| `ctx docs` | embedded documentation in the binary | selected topic `--out` path for `ctx docs show --out` or selected `--out` directory for `ctx docs man --out` |
| `ctx upgrade` | signed release metadata and installed binary/sidecar metadata | installed binary for manual upgrade, install sidecar, `upgrade-state.json`, `upgrade.lock`, and `logs/upgrade.log` |
| `ctx doctor` | SQLite index, data root metadata, semantic sidecar/status metadata, and ctx-owned daemon lock/status/job metadata | none |
| `ctx daemon status` | semantic sidecar/status metadata and ctx-owned daemon lock/status/job metadata | none |
| `ctx daemon enable` / `ctx daemon disable` | `config.toml` | `config.toml` |
| `ctx daemon run` | native provider transcript files, SQLite index, semantic sidecar/status metadata, model-cache metadata, and ctx-owned daemon lock/status/job metadata | SQLite index for bounded native provider refresh, ctx-owned daemon lock/status/job metadata, and semantic sidecar/status metadata when local semantic indexing or dirty-queue freshness checks run |

Setup, import, and default search do not require source repository writes, model
APIs, API keys, or remote accounts. Without semantic opt-in they do not download
models or runtime assets; with semantic enabled, installer/runtime acquisition
and daemon maintenance may acquire the local ONNX Runtime asset and embedding
model when the installed build supports that path. Non-JSON setup and native provider imports may opportunistically start
the ctx-owned background daemon maintenance profile when `[daemon].enabled` is true; use
`ctx setup --no-daemon` or `ctx import --no-daemon` for a one-run opt-out.
`ctx setup --catalog-only`, `ctx setup --json`, and `ctx import --json` do not
autostart daemon maintenance.
`ctx search --refresh off` does not refresh providers, run plugins, autostart
daemon maintenance, start semantic workers, schedule semantic indexing, or write
the main store or semantic sidecar. Default `--backend hybrid --refresh off`
uses semantic evidence only when sidecar coverage is complete and dirty work is
drained, and otherwise falls back to lexical. Explicit semantic searches may ask
the daemon query service to embed the query from an already-cached local model
and read partial existing sidecar coverage, but they do not download a model or
write semantic catch-up work during search.
Explicit imports may best-effort mark recent semantic-eligible items dirty in
the semantic sidecar when the sidecar already exists; this does not create the
sidecar, initialize the model, or embed text.
Explicit semantic search also refuses to initialize or download the embedding
model when the required local cache is missing; hybrid falls back to lexical in
that case. Default `--refresh background` lets daemon maintenance own enabled
auto history-source plugin refresh when possible, and may autostart the
configured daemon query service for semantic/hybrid retrieval; use
`--refresh wait` or `ctx import` for exhaustive foreground plugin catch-up.

When `ctx daemon run` or setup/import autostart runs the ctx-owned background
coordinator, it stores private lock/status files under `daemon/` in the ctx data
root. Setup/import autostart uses the normal background daemon profile and exits
after it becomes idle; explicit `ctx daemon run` runs the same coordinator in
the foreground. The current coordinator status surface is local-only: bounded
native provider-history refresh updates the local SQLite index, semantic
indexing is bounded by the local runtime/model availability, and cloud sync
reports `disabled` with `enabled: false` and `network_allowed: false`.
A looping daemon may keep the
local embedding model resident between passes and uses the sidecar dirty queue
to prioritize recent/stale events. With semantic enabled and default background
refresh, search may start the configured daemon so the daemon-owned query
service can embed the query; `ctx search --refresh off` does not start it.

## Config Overrides

`ctx setup`, `ctx import`, and `ctx search` do not create `config.toml` for
implicit defaults. The config file is for user-managed overrides. Existing
config files are read and left in place.

Daemon maintenance is disabled by default during the prerelease. Enable it with:

```toml
[daemon]
enabled = true
```

`daemon.enabled = true` allows non-JSON setup and native provider imports to
opportunistically start the ctx-owned background daemon maintenance profile.
Use `ctx setup --no-daemon` or `ctx import --no-daemon` for a one-run opt-out.
`ctx daemon enable` and `ctx daemon disable` write only the `[daemon] enabled`
override.

Local semantic search requires daemon maintenance and is also disabled by
default. The prerelease opt-in is:

```toml
[daemon]
enabled = true

[search]
semantic = true
```

`upgrade.auto = "apply"` remains the implicit default for official
installer-managed binaries with a valid install sidecar. Unmanaged installs do
not self-upgrade. Set `auto = "off"` or use `ctx upgrade disable` to disable
background auto-upgrade for the configured data root.

## Index Lifecycle

Find the active ctx root before destructive maintenance:

```bash
ctx status
```

The default root is `~/.ctx`. If you set `CTX_DATA_ROOT` or pass `--data-root`,
use that root in the commands below instead.

Re-import or update the index:

```bash
ctx import --all
ctx import --resume
ctx import --provider codex --path ~/.codex/sessions
ctx import --format ctx-history-jsonl-v1 --path ./history.jsonl
ctx import --history-source example-agent/default
```

Current adapters are safe to re-run. They rescan sources idempotently and keep
source paths or cursors when available. Imports always commit valid records and
report rejected records. Sources with no usable imported content fail, as do
unreadable or incompatible sources; ctx-owned storage or index failures abort
the command. Native
provider cursor progress is scoped by provider,
source format, and an opaque source identity derived from the configured root or
source path, so two roots for the same provider do not overwrite each other's
progress.
Custom history JSONL imports follow the same v1 lifecycle: ctx rescans the
explicit file, upserts already-imported records, stores supplied source cursor
metadata under ctx-owned custom cursor streams, and preserves event native
cursors. History-source plugins receive the previous stored cursor on each
explicit import and stream the same JSONL format to stdout. Failed plugin runs
do not advance cursors. Explicit file paths and plugin manifests are not added
to `config.toml` or treated as fixed provider homes.

## Upgrade Reindexing

When an existing `0.8.x` or `0.9.x` data root is opened by `0.10.x` or newer, ctx keeps
the SQLite database and migrates it in place. The migration rebuilds derived
search projections and marks prior provider import cache rows pending so the
next normal refresh can re-read original provider transcripts.

This is a one-time reimport, not a destructive wipe. It is needed because older
indexes can lack touched-file metadata or can contain text that was sanitized
before storage. If the original provider transcript files still exist, refresh
replaces those old rows with current local/private transcript text. If source
files were deleted or moved, ctx can still return indexed text from SQLite but
cannot reconstruct text that was already stored as a placeholder.

Writable opens also repair a historical provider-identity transition that
could leave multiple physical rows for one provider session. Rows are treated
as the same source when they share either a nonempty source identity or the
same nonempty raw source path, provided their known source formats are
compatible. The repair keeps the oldest session and event IDs canonical, moves
genuinely new events onto that session, retains the newer duplicate row's
session relationships and state, and keeps removed duplicate IDs as
compatibility aliases. Different raw paths with different source identities
remain distinct. The store also rejects future same-source duplicates at write
time.

Remove a source from future imports:

```bash
$EDITOR ~/.ctx/config.toml
```

The current CLI does not add provider source entries to `config.toml`; default
provider locations are discovered each time and explicit `--path` imports are
not remembered as future defaults. Custom history JSONL paths are also
one-shot explicit imports. To remove already indexed data, rebuild the index and
import only the sources you still want.

## SQL Inspection

`ctx sql` is a read-only advanced inspection command for cases normal search
does not express, such as exact counts, joins, audits, and one-off scripts. It
opens the existing SQLite store in read-only mode, rejects writes, rejects
multiple statements, enforces row/column/value caps, and times out long-running
queries. It also applies SQLite runtime limits to bound SQL text and generated
value allocation. It does not initialize or migrate the store; run a writable
command such as `ctx setup` or `ctx import` first when a schema migration is
required.

Stable read-only views are the preferred compatibility surface:

- `ctx_sessions`;
- `ctx_events`;
- `ctx_files_touched`;
- `ctx_sources`.

Run `ctx docs show sql` for view schemas, examples, limits, and output formats.
Internal tables remain local and queryable, but they are implementation details
and can change across versions. SQL output is private local history by default.

Reset and rebuild the index:

```bash
rm -f ~/.ctx/work.sqlite ~/.ctx/work.sqlite-wal ~/.ctx/work.sqlite-shm
ctx setup
```

This removes the local SQLite index and recreates it from provider history. It
does not delete raw provider transcript files.

Inspect storage size:

```bash
du -sh ~/.ctx
du -h ~/.ctx/work.sqlite*
ctx status --json
```

Delete all ctx data:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.ctx
```

This removes ctx's local index, config, and logs for the default root. It does
not remove provider-owned history such as `~/.codex/sessions`.

## Privacy Truth

Indexed prompts, code, commands, file paths, and failed-output diagnostic
previews may contain credentials, customer data, private repository names, or
proprietary design notes.

Recommended handling:

- keep `~/.ctx` out of source repositories;
- do not share SQLite databases or logs;
- review JSON output before sharing it outside the machine;
- delete or reinitialize the local store when working on shared machines;
- use provider filters and result limits to keep agent retrieval focused on
  relevant material.

## Network Behavior

Core indexing work uses local filesystem and SQLite operations. The tools that
originally produced provider transcripts may have used the network according to
their own configuration; ctx indexing those transcripts does not repeat that
behavior.

Official installer-managed binaries can contact the signed release metadata
endpoint for `ctx upgrade` and for background auto-upgrade checks after
successful normal commands. These checks are skipped for `ctx status`, JSON
commands, MCP, `ctx docs`, `ctx sql`, `ctx upgrade`, CI, unmanaged installs, and
process-level opt-outs such as `CTX_UPGRADE_OFF=1` or
`CTX_DISABLE_AUTO_UPGRADE=1`. Upgrade metadata checks do not send provider
transcript text, search queries, result snippets, source paths, repository
names, or command output.

First-party analytics are default-on and may create `install.json` plus a
separate device identity file in OS user state, then send coarse product
metadata. They do not send session text, prompts, transcripts, search queries,
result snippets, source paths, repository or branch names, native session IDs,
command text, command output, usernames, hostnames, raw IP addresses, exact
CPU or GPU names, serial numbers, hardware IDs, live utilization, or benchmark
results. Coarse capability ranges are bucketed before they are sent and are not
used to derive a machine identity.

Analytics may include:

- generated random install and device identifiers that are hashed server-side;
- ctx version, OS, architecture, command name, success state, and duration
  bucket;
- JSON-output and option booleans such as whether a search used filters;
- bucketed counts such as indexed sessions, import totals, result counts, and
  validation finding counts;
- a versioned coarse execution-capability snapshot, including available
  parallelism, host-visible memory range, CPU vector support, and whether the
  platform is a candidate for Apple Neural Engine or NVIDIA CUDA acceleration,
  without loading an accelerator runtime or collecting component names;
- bucketed search query length and term count, but not query content;
- provider identifiers such as `codex` or `claude` when selected as filters;
- coarse Cloudflare-derived geography such as country, region, colo, ASN, and
  AS organization.

The install identifier lives in `install.json` under the configured ctx data
root and represents that local index. The device identifier is a random UUID
created only when analytics are enabled and an event is sent; it lives outside
the ctx data root in OS user state, such as `$XDG_STATE_HOME/ctx/device.json` or
`~/.local/state/ctx/device.json` on Linux.
When a capability snapshot is eligible, ctx also creates a private versioned
claim in that state directory and promotes it to a version marker after
delivery. This avoids routinely sending the same snapshot again. If delivery
fails or is interrupted, the claim remains in place so ctx does not risk
replaying a snapshot whose delivery status is uncertain.

`ctx sql` and MCP do not send first-party analytics events.

To disable analytics, add:

```toml
[analytics]
enabled = false
```

Equivalent environment opt-outs are `CTX_ANALYTICS_OFF=1`,
`CTX_DISABLE_ANALYTICS=1`, or `CTX_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=false`. Use an opt-out when
a strict local-only no-network mode is required.
