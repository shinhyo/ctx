# Upgrade

`ctx upgrade` checks and applies signed ctx CLI releases for binaries installed
by the official hosted installer.

```bash
ctx upgrade status
ctx upgrade status --format json
ctx upgrade check
ctx upgrade check --format json
ctx upgrade --dry-run
ctx upgrade
ctx upgrade disable
ctx upgrade enable
```

The installer writes a sidecar marker next to the binary, such as
`~/.local/bin/ctx.install.json`, recording the managed install path, platform,
version, channel, binary SHA-256, metadata URL, and artifact URL. Source builds,
`cargo install`, package-manager installs, and copied binaries without that
marker are unmanaged and will not self-upgrade. A present but invalid marker
is an inconsistent managed installation and also fails closed.

On Unix, new official managed installations record the canonical man-page
directory and exact file names and hashes installed there. After the managed
binary changes, ctx makes one best-effort refresh of only those recorded pages;
it never searches for or glob-deletes `ctx*.1`. Missing, malformed, legacy, or
disabled receipts are ignored. Modified, missing, symlinked, unsafe, or
unexpected paths are also left alone without affecting the command. An
interrupted refresh may remain stale; regenerate explicitly with `ctx docs man
--out DIR` when needed. `--no-man` and custom installer directories remain
respected. Windows and unmanaged installations do nothing.
`ctx upgrade status --format json` also lists every `ctx` binary found on `PATH` and
warns when another binary shadows the managed install.

Automatic upgrades are available only for a valid managed installation. The
managed default is `upgrade.auto = "apply"`; without a valid installer marker,
the effective mode is `off` even when config or process environment requests
`apply`. This derived result is not persisted, so converting an unmanaged
install does not leave a sticky opt-out. Signed release metadata must also
allow automatic application. With automatic indexing and the full daemon
profile, the enabled persistent daemon is the sole
automatic-upgrade authority. It owns cadence and backoff, signed metadata and
artifact requests, staging, daemon handoff, and replacement. Ordinary
foreground commands and MCP never claim or spawn automatic upgrade work, and
finite Core indexing workers do not perform it. Manual indexing and
`daemon.mode = "source-refresh-only"` therefore perform no automatic checks.
Output format does not change these rules. Explicit `ctx upgrade` remains
available independently of daemon and automatic-upgrade settings.

Use `ctx index mode` to inspect the indexing mode. `ctx index mode auto`
restores automatic indexing and its persistent daemon when no process-level
override disables it; `ctx index mode manual` stops the daemon and removes its
supervision without changing `upgrade.auto`. Automatic checks resume only after
the full persistent daemon is restored.

Use `CTX_UPGRADE_AUTO=off` for a process-level opt-out. For a persistent opt-out,
run `ctx upgrade disable`; it writes `upgrade.auto = "off"` in `config.toml`.
On a managed install, run `ctx upgrade enable` to restore
`upgrade.auto = "apply"`. On an unmanaged or inconsistent install, enable
fails with conversion/recovery guidance before writing config. `ctx upgrade
status`, `ctx status`, and `ctx doctor` report the effective mode after install
authority, config, and process overrides.

## Fix upgrade diagnostics

If a diagnostic says another `ctx` shadows the managed executable on `PATH`,
put the managed install directory before the reported shadowing directory and
restart the shell. On POSIX shells, `command -v -a ctx` shows the resolution
order; in PowerShell, use `Get-Command ctx -All`.

An absent install marker is normal for a source build or package-manager
install and leaves ctx unmanaged. The hosted installer will not silently adopt
that executable. Unmanaged installations never write upgrade locks or state
beside the executable, so read-only package-manager directories (for example
Nix) keep working. Daemon coordination remains unified under `~/.ctx`, `ctx
upgrade check` stays lock-free and stateless, and `ctx upgrade` or `ctx upgrade
enable` reports the unmanaged guidance instead of a directory-permission error.
A marker that is malformed, unsupported, path-mismatched, or does not match the
binary hash leaves the executable and marker as an inconsistent pair; do not
edit or overwrite the sidecar in place.

Before moving or removing either an unmanaged executable or an inconsistent
executable/marker pair, run the lifecycle handoff with the currently installed
executable:

```bash
ctx daemon disable --prepare-uninstall --format=json
```

Continue only after the command succeeds and its JSON receipt reports a
quiescent installation. The receipt is point-in-time rather than a persistent
launch fence: do not run ctx again, and proceed directly to the serialized
replacement operation. Then move or remove the unmanaged executable, or both
members of the inconsistent pair, and rerun the platform-correct hosted
installer. On Linux or macOS:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ctx.rs/install | sh
```

On Windows:

```powershell
irm https://ctx.rs/install.ps1 | iex
```

Alternatively, after the successful handoff, choose a different empty binary
directory (`BinDir` on Windows) and make sure `PATH` resolves `ctx` to the
intended installation. See `ctx docs show unmanaged-installs` for the complete
conversion procedure and required receipt fields.

Manual `ctx upgrade` verifies signed release metadata, explicit self-upgrade
policy, artifact SHA-256, the current managed install marker, and the staged
binary's `ctx --version` output before replacing the installed binary.

The production binary reads stable release metadata from
`https://cli.ctx.rs/functions/v2/releases/stable/ctx-release-metadata.env`.
Staging retains
`https://cli.ctx.rs/functions/v1/releases/staging/ctx-release-metadata.env`.
The binary derives the detached signature URL from that metadata URL, verifies
with its embedded release public key, and accepts artifact URLs only under the
compiled
`https://cli.ctx.rs/storage/v1/object/public/releases/artifacts/` authority.
Config files and process environment variables cannot replace those origins or
the verification key. A key or authority change therefore requires a new ctx
binary, not a shell-profile or config-file change.

When semantic search is explicitly enabled with the built-in executor, the same
signed release metadata may carry the semantic asset catalog. ctx verifies the
metadata signature before it accepts any catalog URL, archive hash,
expanded-size limit, or per-file hash. Downloads are streamed with role-specific
byte limits, and archive extraction accepts only the signed regular-file
inventory. Semantic search remains off by default; a disabled semantic
configuration neither selects nor downloads these assets.

The selected catalog entry pairs one exact model with one local backend:
ONNX Runtime 1.27.0 for portable CPU execution, WindowsML 2.1.74 with DirectML
on Windows, or the pinned Linux x86_64 CUDA 12 runtime including its CUDA and
cuDNN user-space libraries. Apple silicon uses the signed Core ML bundle.
The CUDA package still requires a compatible NVIDIA driver from the host.

Model and runtime publication participates in the existing upgrade transaction
and recovery journal. A failed publication rolls back the previous paths.
Running `ctx upgrade` again at the same CLI version repairs a missing or
hash-mismatched selected semantic asset from the signed catalog without
changing the CLI version.

On Windows, replacement may be scheduled by a helper that finishes after the
running `ctx.exe` exits; JSON reports `status: "scheduled"` and
`applied: false` until replacement completes.

One scheduler state, `.ctx.upgrade-state.json`, and one replacement transaction
journal live beside the managed executable. The executable-adjacent
`.ctx.install.lock` coordinates all data roots sharing that installation.
Daemon lifecycle and supervisor coordination is separate and unified under the
canonical `~/.ctx` root. `ctx upgrade status` reads the scheduler state and
shows failed-check details.
Upgrade metadata checks do not send provider transcript text, search queries,
result snippets, source paths, repository names, or command output.
