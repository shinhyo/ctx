# Work Model

ctx is organized around Work Records. A record is the durable history for one coding-agent task.

## Record

A Work Record has an id, title, body, kind, tags, optional workspace path, optional pull request URL, and timestamps. It should be small enough to review as one unit and complete enough that another engineer can understand the work without reading terminal scrollback.

Typical record kinds:

- `task`: a unit of coding-agent work
- `note`: a durable observation, prompt, or handoff note
- `decision`: a choice made during the work
- `review`: context for a pull request or review pass

`ctx record` creates records. `ctx list`, `ctx show`, and `ctx search` retrieve them.

## Evidence

Evidence is command output captured by `ctx evidence run` or imported from a
local Git/jj/gh shim capture. Each evidence item stores:

- the command string
- exit code
- safe stdout and stderr previews in SQLite
- full stdout and stderr as local-only blob artifacts
- start time
- duration
- optional record id

This is the current local evidence model. Store file paths, reproduction notes, or links in the record body when they matter.

## Local shims

`ctx shim install --dir <path>` creates local wrapper scripts for `git`, `jj`,
and `gh`. The wrappers run the real command found later on `PATH`, preserve its
exit code, and spool command metadata plus stdout/stderr to the JSONL capture
inbox. `ctx capture import` imports those pending envelopes into the local
record store. `ctx shim uninstall --dir <path>` removes only ctx-marked wrapper
scripts.

## Capture spool

The capture spool is a local JSONL inbox for integrations that already know how
to emit ctx capture envelopes. `ctx capture import` turns pending envelopes into
records and evidence in the local store. Normal Work Recorder commands also
import pending envelopes before serving results, so wrapper captures become
visible without a daemon.

The importer is intentionally narrower than passive history import:

- it imports files already written to the Work Recorder inbox;
- it uses stable ids derived from envelope dedupe keys when ids are omitted;
- it moves successful files to `.done`;
- it moves failed files to `.failed` and writes an error sidecar.

`ctx doctor` reports failed or stuck spool files. `ctx repair` retries failed
spool files after inspection.

Local Git/jj/gh wrapper shims are the first implemented capture writer for this
spool. Provider-native hooks and shell hooks remain future product direction.
Provider imports are separate explicit commands: normalized Codex/Claude/Pi
fixture JSONL and Codex prompt-history JSONL with `summary_only` fidelity.

## Pull requests

`ctx link-pr <record-id> <url>` attaches a pull request URL to a record. The
link stays with the local record and appears in redacted `show`, report, and
context output as well as private archive export.

`ctx publish pr-comment <record-id>` uses the authenticated local `gh` CLI to
create or update one marker-bounded ctx comment on the linked GitHub pull
request. `--dry-run` renders the same comment locally for review. Hosted/team
publishing is outside the current local-first implementation.

## Context and reports

`ctx context [query]` renders matching records and evidence as work context.
`ctx report` summarizes recent recorded work in text or JSON. `ctx dashboard
export` writes a static local HTML dashboard for visual review. These review
surfaces redact secret-like values and local paths by default; archive export is
the private full-fidelity data path.

Use these commands before review, handoff, or resuming a paused task. They turn the local record store into a concise packet of what happened.

## Workspace

A record can include the workspace where the work happened. That path gives commands and notes their execution context.

ctx does not require a special agent runtime. You can use Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, shell scripts, GitHub CLI, or a manual editor workflow. The record is the stable layer around those tools.

`ctx vcs inspect` can add repository context outside the record itself. It
detects Git metadata, redacts remotes, reports worktree state, computes a stable
repository fingerprint, and reports jj workspace metadata when `jj` is
installed. `ctx pr parse` normalizes supported GitHub and GitLab pull request
URLs before a URL is attached with `ctx link-pr`.

## Storage lifecycle

`ctx setup` creates the local store, `ctx status` prints its paths and initialization state, and `ctx uninstall --yes` removes the local Work Recorder product data.

## Boundaries

The current open recorder focuses on explicit local records and review packets.
It does not yet passively capture provider sessions, import existing local agent
history, or sync hosted team data. Pull request comment publishing is limited
to local GitHub PR upsert through `gh`.

Hosted team sync, shared policy enforcement, centralized dashboards, and
organization-level analytics are separate product concerns and are not part of
the current local-first implementation.

The launch threat model is documented in [threat-model.md](threat-model.md).
Hosted Option A requires a separate threat model before it can be documented as
implemented.
