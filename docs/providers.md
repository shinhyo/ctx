# Providers

ctx imports existing agent history through provider adapters. Each adapter must
make a narrow, testable claim about the source format it reads and the event
fields it indexes.

## Supported Local Imports

The current CLI imports local history for:

- Codex session JSONL trees under `~/.codex/sessions`;
- Codex `~/.codex/history.jsonl`;
- Pi `~/.pi/sessions.jsonl` when that local file exists and matches the
  supported JSONL format.

Use `ctx sources` for the truth on the current machine:

```bash
ctx sources
ctx sources --json
```

If a provider is not listed by `ctx sources`, the current CLI does not discover
or import that provider's native history.

## Normalized Harness Imports

The CLI also accepts explicit normalized provider JSONL for Claude, OpenCode,
Antigravity, Gemini, and Cursor. This path is for adapter harnesses, generated
test histories, and future native importer development. It is not native
provider history discovery.

If one of these providers is selected without `--path`, `ctx import` returns an
error explaining that an explicit normalized provider JSONL path is required.
Do not document one of these providers as natively locally importable until the
CLI can discover or parse that provider's real local history and the provider
support matrix marks the shipped path accordingly.

## Live Provider E2E

Live provider E2E is opt-in proof, not a provider runner. The lane never
executes provider CLIs, never passes credential environment variables to `ctx`,
and runs `ctx` with a temporary `CTX_DATA_ROOT`.

Only Codex and Pi have live E2E lanes because those are the providers with
native local import paths in the public CLI. A live run requires
`CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_E2E=1`, `CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_ACCEPT_LOCAL_HISTORY=1`, the
provider selector (`CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_CODEX=1` or `CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_PI=1`),
an explicit local history path, and a deterministic retrieval query through
`CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_CODEX_QUERY`, `CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_PI_QUERY`, or the shared
`CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_QUERY` fallback:

```bash
CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_E2E=1 \
CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_ACCEPT_LOCAL_HISTORY=1 \
CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_CODEX=1 \
CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_CODEX_SESSIONS_PATH=/path/to/.codex/sessions \
CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_CODEX_QUERY='private local query' \
scripts/release-provider-live-e2e-lanes.sh run codex

CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_E2E=1 \
CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_ACCEPT_LOCAL_HISTORY=1 \
CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_PI=1 \
CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_PI_SESSIONS_PATH=/path/to/.pi/sessions.jsonl \
CTX_LIVE_PROVIDER_PI_QUERY='private local query' \
scripts/release-provider-live-e2e-lanes.sh run pi
```

The resulting `live-e2e.json` and `live-e2e.md` contain aggregate counts and
booleans only. They must not include raw transcripts, snippets, queries, or
source paths. Provider-specific native lanes for providers without native
local-history importers produce blocked artifacts instead of passing live proof.

There is also a default-off generated OpenRouter lane. That lane uses
`scripts/run-openrouter-provider-e2e-infisical.sh` to hydrate OpenRouter
credential and endpoint configuration from Infisical before `ctx import` creates
temporary synthetic multi-session histories for every harness provider. If the
Buildkite agent hook already hydrated OpenRouter env from Infisical, the wrapper
uses that pre-hydrated environment without requiring an `infisical` binary. It
then runs the same scrubbed `ctx setup`, `ctx import`, `ctx search`, `ctx
context`, `ctx status`, `ctx doctor`, and `ctx validate` flow. It proves ctx
retrieval over generated provider histories; it does not prove native vendor
transcript discovery.

Bazel provider-live targets skip the `ctx` build when the lane is skipped or
only writes native-import blocker artifacts. When a real Codex, Pi, or generated
OpenRouter run is selected, the wrapper may build or use `ctx`, but the lane
runtime still uses only `ctx` commands with credential and provider CLI
environments left out.

## Import Rules

Provider imports should be:

- read-only with respect to provider-owned files;
- explicit through `ctx import`;
- safe to interrupt and re-run, using idempotent rescans or provider cursors
  when available;
- idempotent for unchanged source files;
- clear about which fields were indexed and which were left raw-only;
- conservative when a transcript schema is unknown or malformed.

## Fidelity

An imported session may include messages, tool calls, command events, output
previews, file references, parent/child agent relationships, usage metadata, and
lifecycle events. Not every provider exposes every field.

Search and context output must identify the provider and cite the source path or
cursor when available so an agent can verify important details.
